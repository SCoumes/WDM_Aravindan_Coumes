In addition, the potential moderating effects of firm strategy and the environment on the outsourcing-performance relationship were examined. Results indicate that, whereas there was no significant direct effect of outsourcing on firm performance, both firm strategy and environmental dynamism moderated the relationship between outsourcing and performance.", "authors": [{"name": "K.

The UAE's logistics industry is expanding its wings as new entrepreneurs are entering the field, contributing new technology-based solutions and services. The blending of conventional logistics players and startups can be seen in the UAE. The challenge in the logistics market is how the existing companies face the positive competition from newcomers which are well versed in using new trends such as artificial intelligence, and the business is transparent by the Internet growth whereas traditional logistics company uses networking. The revolution of the Internet has supported the logistic companies to assemble the buyers and sellers in a single platform with better process giving simple solution unlike the old lengthy method of finding vehicles, fleet and tracking delivery points. Due to rapid expeditious, enlarging trade volume, revival of the worldwide economy, extraordinary development of construction and large-scale projects, development of transportation infrastructure and geographical location of the UAE which is an added advantage connecting the trading pathways of the West, Europe, Africa and Asia, have made the UAE as an international transit hub. Due to the improvement of growth of business dynamics all over the world, outsourcing is a huge market in the United Arab Emirates. Previously various studies were undertaken to find the third-party logistics status in different countries. To the author\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understanding, there was no survey conducted before in the United Arab Emirates from provider perspective and based on the capital city of Abu Dhabi. The aim of this research is to conduct a survey in order to examine the 3PL status in different areas. This paper reveals the maximum percentages of 3PL customers are satisfied with their present 3PL service provider and it has led the positive impact on the customer gratification and reduction of the logistics cost. As a result, the 3PL services are growing fast in Abu Dhabi.", "authors": [{"name": "Ashok Rajendran Rajendran", "ids": ["1657611529"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "R.

We explore this issue for Belgian SMEs because there are important differences in disclosure and audit requirements among them. Consistent with the traditional view that asymmetric or incomplete information restricts access to external funds, our results indicate that both the amount and the quality of financial statement information are positively related to SME leverage. In addition, we find that leverage is positively related to asset structure, growth (prospects) and median industry leverage; and negatively related to firm age and profitability.", "authors": [{"name": "Tom Van Caneghem", "ids": ["3067456"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Geert Van Campenhout", "ids": ["3120806"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["f079365c64357d1deb149fd9e0edcc14eeab2ed5", "575c530271e09af02359cb26c420880f2e308bba", "e474938cdd737b6ff07819bf70ec1bafe68a9c11", "35d4c0ddd65606b363bd72cf2e6330943a77128e", "40b278fd8a21b692a62d7f73e0ae174c9255bb35"], "outCitations": ["fdf450a085c2b6b6b82b41de2c793506befe743d", "ce9ddb7882bbd503d9fe45e467c875cbc5b32f0e", "1a7a9eb3b8e4074a0b968bf166894558d5cda148", "683f02a959b5ad06b439354a02cf8cdba2f1836f", "dd44c41c4b47e8e2f7769c70731b278d93dde1ff", "deb79449b136cbb639d0e83064ef57344954fbe0", "6d3dd56f49fbdbd4e78ae9514639dd941757a689", "a506bb11ac0bf125a9850ae7bb7988af37c2ebd4", "1529069581c5c0e38b56c60512b42b5ff47ec22b", "577cc7c9872cb8748ef3db89fc387d2706da7e23", "fddfe0489b677be5e17d2aa2f9ec1da5ce64914a", "776c3afe28ad619f5769e467a3bbe79ead2dbaf0", "dc4e557139649dccd05581068a29adece20a6e1f", "0437d4df9ec104e9663ee81aefed685f82dab3ee", "840c8e1621d083cffd5fd5f31364d21d3260b894", "8fb49d18d8f887ebd1250d7dc9b7711850b3f1a6", "ac95a145b6b7fa872a54eba4f13d985dd597400f", "5dcdeb6d9ebedd399243d2c79219b61af2428def", "a5e366800503da8c1bc65025e8bd3ac81f1130f1", "96c20551f39e533d86e24486904a4282f62276b5", "c272bfb914d1df667b746aa46b673019b50a997a", "c1c4411b0478b7e8ff127fa0f99b7b1523dde117", "fcdfbde1dc05f4e336ebe680998e28e5f60d8ae9", "547fdd7ad8305465cc3a10c1b3f777c0bda69a55", "f47e1a348beb1c9cc41833d8e5a668fcd51bed7a", "7fc9d55e4fe715c2bf0f9b16cfcff48fe8b52d9a", "4f8cac7054d0893009a2eb92092b8060f957d451", "81c84afa78c3445b783db0b9dbec3b70f2cb3a19", "ae2c45da2a3cdef7c278194632957b683add1cfc", "b48f83c16988e964ec632caab821fa866c4bb280", "458868b4f345ee188e10a070d218d8d5710e5813", "9c9518d65ba4bdc1c10d6ad82b89552ba2d0b078", "21f423b4a16d4df764f225a33e9c5ef83ec8df96", "7176c858a5642014ec938a2cad83b19e0c38c87f", "4d042186d40ea54103fe1686de2b3b190374a3e8", "540de3c11df3eaa779407309d7f5b3f2a90a48df", "4434e30d333efc4969296f8ed615451d86ac6678", "ee2c3b50f6b890ac71dae535b2523c8abb378cc6", "8ebf68cfebd9e27089c5d1cb5240e6d99b4b0c88", "86d0b558a645590eccd5baab496ff1c4d55e2d02", "ebe10b120082e57be16d4054ee47157f9d04aeb4", "9acb586a83fdb35b02958cdf8c102b6867ec3d2d"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d76647ba5831dd5b4ea05738df56c0d0bbce091f", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "Social Science Research Network", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.2139/SSRN.1541793", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.2139/SSRN.1541793", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3125394580", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Strategies, such as wall murals that camouflage doors, and locator devices, offer proactive options for keeping persons with dementia who wander safer. Information that describes available strategies to mitigate this issue is diverse and inconsistent, creating challenges for caregivers and persons living with dementia when choosing helpful strategies. This project aimed to describe the spectrum of risks and risk mitigation strategies associated with dementia-related wandering. Thirty-eight phone interviews from across Canada were conducted with stakeholders including persons with dementia, paid and family caregivers, health professionals, law enforcement, and Alzheimer societies. Interviewees were asked about strategies that they have used to manage dementia-related wandering, and how their perceptions of risk, culture, stigma and geographical location may influence strategy adoption. Overall, a wide range of high- and low-tech solutions were used or suggested by participants, and factors such as risk, culture, geography and stigma were considered essential elements to successful adoption of these strategies.

Knowledge of job deficiencies of employees scheduled to move into positions of pending retirees is essential for training and workforce succession management. This article provides guidance about workforce succession by analyzing perceived training competency/needs of National Park Service resource management professionals. A gap analysis was used to analyze perceived differences in preparation for and importance of specific competencies for advanced-level job classifications (GS-12 grades and above). Results indicated that Program Managers (n = 117) reported \u201clarge gaps\u201d or deficiencies in training for 18 out of 34 competencies measured. There were also significant differences (p \u2264 .05) between the perceived gaps of three age cohorts, with the cohort group most likely to succeed retirees the most deficient.

In line with theoretical predictions that credit lines aid firms to invest during times of limited credit availability, our findings reveal that the liquidity insurance function of lines of credit does facilitate the undertaking of value-enhancing investments during severe credit market conditions. Although the financial crisis did reduce firm investment, this effect was mitigated somewhat by credit line usage. We also find that in contrast to non-crisis times, during the crisis older, higher net worth firms were more likely to have access to credit lines.

In this regard, firm size was considered as the control variable. The disclosure quality was measured using the scores that Securities and Exchange Organization of Tehran gives to companies, which are made available through the report on 'Disclosure quality and appropriate information'. The scores range from zero to 100. Four criterion variables including the number of shares traded, rate of stock turnover, volume of stock exchanges in Rial, and value of shares traded were used to measure liquidity. The sample of the study consisted of 70 companies over the period 2006 to 2011. Considering the five fiscal years for every company, the study covered the data on 350 company-years. The results of data analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between firm size and securities liquidity. This significance results from the relationships among three criterion variables including the number of shares traded, volume of stock exchanges in Rial and value of shares traded. However, the results showed no significant correlation between disclosure quality and securities liquidity. This lack of significance results from a lack of significant correlation among three liquidity variables including the number of shares traded, rate of stock turnover and volume of stock exchanges in Rial. It should be noted that due to the conceptual model and large numbers obtained for firm size, the volume of stock exchanges in Rial and value of shares in Rial, the natural logarithm of the numbers of these three variables were used in the regression model.", "authors": [{"name": "Azar  Karkon", "ids": ["121481587"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Reza  Mazhari", "ids": ["4688838"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["f4a7db1b3bd62c3a3026fc88d8d65bc3981e081f"], "outCitations": ["8f2257b0dc3ea79c54891928ff237aaccfad1266", "e38ce4bf3c85b7054000cc33eb93c5ce36cda7ba", "1ae0389b40f53410719a9da51322716855bd2f39", "9a8af13c49002d36b9a0a5083623f8a0190a5d5f", "1b7ef1726398a1bcb951833316af75c8f3515428", "356eebd57f0dc4b43f7452f2a990689d2205b465", "337826a92fcda16db898dc5cb805603c72c7f6a9", "5bae7f7d6f47bb6eed317ccb8db6af5c6b4ac17a", "f278b1c9432556b29c92e7ded457ae9b98c16576"], "year": 2013, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a5554d725f67e4212adc52df61bebaa6b667e484", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://irjmsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/paper17.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2188445841", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

The earnings of banks that elect to operate under Subchapter S of the Federal tax code are not subject to the Federal corporate income tax, but S-bank shareholders are taxed on their pro rata share of the entire earnings of the bank. The number of banks electing Subchapter S tax treatment has increased rapidly, especially among small banks. Using estimates of the Federal corporate income tax that S-banks would pay if they were subject to the tax, this article shows that differences in the tax treatment of S-banks and other banks has a large impact on measures of U.S. banking system profitability. Further, the article shows that adjustment of S-bank earnings by estimates of Federal income taxes to make them comparable with the earnings of other banks can markedly affect conclusions of studies that use net income as a measure of performance. Finally, the article shows that S-banks tend to out-earn their peers even if S-bank earnings are reduced by estimated Federal taxes, and that S-banks also tend to have higher earnings rates than their peers in the year before they elect S-bank status.", "authors": [{"name": "R.

To date adoption rates for both range from 20-25%. Some studies suggest that economic conditions and technological capability improve adoption rates. However, extant literature has not assessed the role of more recent technological developments, such as online activity and in-house software adoption, or assessed effects of the recent global economic crisis. This study explores the impact of such technology and economic conditions on ABC and ABM implementation at top companies in the Republic of Ireland. \nThe research adopts a contingency approach and a positivist ontology, using an online survey instrument as its primary method. A questionnaire was sent to 824 Irish companies. The data gathered was analysed using factor analysis and regression analysis. Factor analysis supported consideration of the independent variables associated with Information Technology (IT) and economic conditions and identification of additional variables. The findings reveal the rate of implementation and adoption of ABC and ABM is 18.7%; similar to that reported previously. The data reveals a statistically significant relationship between information technology resources and ABC and ABM implementation. \nThis study provides an original contribution, in that it explores the relationship between more recent major changes in technology and changes in economic conditions to ABC and ABM implementation.

The aim of this study was to investigate factors that may influence the revenue share of exporting tomato paste companies to be more competitive in Asian and global markets. A gravity-like model was specified in panel data form including 12 Iranian companies exporting to 16 partner countries, i.e., 192 cross-sections during 8 years. In contrast to similar models, the dependent variable involved fractional data and zeros. Therefore, the generalized linear family was used for the model estimation. Except number of documents required to import, the estimation results expectedly show positive effect of value added per employee, common language and religion on the export revenue share of tomato paste. The negative effect is associated with distance and tariff. It is suggested that the authorities have negotiations with partners, plan to freer trade, update trade equipment and change brands in marketing.

{"id": "cec079114b296e2ad7861172b4331f9b2d80b424", "title": "Does performance evaluation help public managers? A Balanced Scorecard approach in urban waste services.", "paperAbstract": "The urban waste market has evolved significantly in the past decades, which among other changes, has led to the creation of new utilities and new business models. However, very few things have changed for the users. Urban waste collection remains mainly under the responsibility of local authorities and the charges paid by the users in most countries are very low compared to the provision costs. This situation forces the injection of public money into the system, encouraging the 'quiet-life' within the utilities and, therefore, inefficiency. The present study intends to analyze the potential for the application of the Balanced Scorecard (BSc) methodology into the waste utilities. After a comprehensive revision of the urban waste sector in Portugal, the methodology of BSc and its application in local public services is described and discussed. Focusing on implementation rather than on strategy, a set of performance indicators is proposed to be utilized in the different management models of waste utilities in Portugal: the municipalities, semi-autonomous utilities, municipal companies and mixed companies. This implementation is then exemplified through four case studies, one for each type of utility. This paper provides a flexible framework proposal to be applied to waste utilities operating both in Portugal and abroad.", "authors": [{"name": "Bernardo  Guimar\u00e3es", "ids": ["2058656034"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Pedro  Sim\u00f5es", "ids": ["145069692"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Rui Cunha Marques", "ids": ["1977010"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["420f89fb541622d2d5b77ee1a5130870888f7f39", "8718f0aab49410b00441faa4d6437fa9a5b3c1e7", "7d2bace4b3233095543722759151700dbb85d750", "a7a9907a4c994eb615e412c7c2c718cb409c896d", "42422a1ee2f4ab00b5dfc1a06ff3b302e9be30bd", "47163bad23e400841386c7612089f35a27066845", "6dbd0879a1f018db6bdcf965660a9b31bdca2708", "d6885735102adabeebd0b06febabad5d31abc37f", "ea34129d4d1215582447ddbb3a3885702d0c410c", "a6bb57259015b6f1d2b522fa8dfb6903bddd3b56", "0b4a7cfdd0b82c6d5700b0995f45572cdd79b16c", "43d34a9a022affe0f8673b89c862f47d3e8e60d1", "f6a4300d0af4adf815477b40b402e9c38dcd7ca9", "b3aac42f6fab7739f74b7bfad26351a778b2c18a", "e7e77e82266b2b4200d82ca7bc5e37a2f552dd61", "a5e11ce77c2263422cb34fdc089b2254abd773f1", "80fa5d745ea0f7e0ae61e694bdacdacc97197b62", "4efa2060089049d57cd15ed3af3be983a986599f", "c1898878df1a56597927037790d2173b7ac62e2b", "8f155b617ce755ca9e4030c0621996fd092da695", "f0012daee8f00e468f8a551bf0cfc49954f3d3fe", "afa514061a1bafa25f7e708bafcc1a53d3aa1799", "9e057a95c679a534f4c4ebafe38ad520b193c7cd", "f6ce1f38887ce4a0176495d8b9fe22a227fe800d", "5bc21cebfb3fe2fe0a9d6f2f0a0e03e44a9fad24", "0654160314c6d0aa528b927d6a258a9003af211a", "0ecab00ce1b25db015119b3b883ea28eef457df3", "42f73587dd426cf3c6820da9026461881d573850", "5056084fbcf2fdd82fbcba7079f851a5a0feb297", "c5a54aff30a0f0847b36fdc2a06b57a65879dfc3", "6e747afb0a584f44497e83854bae15e6353c9783", "4f50d83d8f044cbf553d625684d3fffd81f5a35f", "d5ee4d7407c66c87f43ab0f54506ee2d72a699e4", "0264c651552a9c2b303f9838e33b2f5b878150d0", "3b19cbc851ac80988ed759443d848d84a24fd930", "949f2763a799120e68d27989364e85230a7ba3b3", "d9bf63ba5be2a0705f17515c220855d61269610d", "d9e46842bf9b2ca14faf63e25c8b3bd178de6f73", "ae5cac6e37e5e14d0b12b68a195594bcce5f91cc", "480b137cc341dd980354f4a21a2a5ba90dc6e357", "e676862a15547714311e84887a9765943b7bd3f9", "00df19807652fe7c710151cac366abfd0a7c175f", "4cf992d3f65fde73f44343779f5893af1a7ecc1c", "581f6a842d4eea9c1ff991e5b2ce192ad1521b7f", "a95176dcb9b8d02cace7864401fdbba6ccbf5d2b", "a1e8aa529f1dd8d11558efb4575d15069ecf97f9", "b11a3237813acb34fac404e8f105c6bfb207b2f8", "97c198d81b4da6d0cdfda0dc61f2eaabbf6fc1a7", "dc1817313babc4bdfb9416b9b3e04f3ab75232b7", "d597ac4e3a037a4c57e35ba40797c747b9435e5b", "2857174f3d75d768e279c67d6ea7f03eaefb0fff", "b794a13fc48197af3c376dd2b3e2aa1292191bce", "79dd188597fdda067ef9e77f13d16d2864d04f98", "2a8f13bad8897ed1a6d6e6325d3812bd1aa8ae32", "6225115d446d157c0a8d16727e4f453601803fc4", "c5b6412b84e99a653a8690cf7080056253926c28", "7a4604988739af7e4b50ce038eb343f012ea67d4", "8572c81e34919de6265adeb8a4981a7d1f38cc7e", "00e22278206b46386e080613c5ea822134e061e2", "187606627844636e45eb7fe8e41abd20030c21fb", "d24c8585e7fd28ae0a23dfa976e627b099889440", "0e4f35ae5b82ac06033a8a0d8590cfd1bc940e86", "36f6b65275e87a40de2f028299368ab14f226b61", "afdc5e2f8c4a474f3fb5e323ffd10b215d59eb8f", "c1502e1183dafec90ef0d885e0876a790d8d6e96", "49c397ad8e1f4e1da034d20c937b3a04ab9b441e", "675878c5570f059d7db6a9f7d6bc1c1ec71df30d", "ace67125d5574b495b475ac67e4e769b0145c81f", "de8d3a99fac0010f64191783201c8c64e621fa78"], "outCitations": ["6b50f22a16a94d6d7837f43b0591328c686bd7a5", "81cad0eb7c05dac2bf403f07211910b01b4fc770", "3ec7ac7e7892b6b7997f24b24b45b330bc4835b4", "46c0ace437ec0e1680cc3058ab759c46b96546bd", "f480245bd06b73c639b7e38394e213e97bbc48c2", "23f291bbb1cc2911ca9421bf03b591b6d63ebffc", "2d46430f7a2eb6c94f0875dbe26913ae1e7cd139", "77daaa6992c7972f88586be5c7972ebd799e9716", "914953beb8ca3c7fa50a2b13c0557da50ee99b3e", "c840a39e1489323436435417a5d16350a7f49b37", "06379b919f836b89ff86750737dade714e7a5b66", "c38b00e6737c4d6a5f9f03da7269834121139491", "0a27f696b786cb6aec938ef6331dd92f71e31b16", "d27d3a62e5a6322b7ef4fac44326dc8dc92f8bfa", "6a80fa0e81b9819734815cc9e0c3ff8a9f3ffe92", "f7d345d1b0c39ff046c1f1d752772305e8d4ed92", "8571a7a92b63e20f3cc4a208a1de58d0fc39e398", "62ca599d7024e47d0a1a4d702af07429b5b7e920", "d403e001be41f75de7de1c183ea364078eb60f68", "d8b26f46a8a970926c19ae50d388aa3c853332bb", "d8812cf51e44e5c96d903f5e5dc815f7b8baa50d"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cec079114b296e2ad7861172b4331f9b2d80b424", "sources": ["Medline"], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "Journal of environmental management", "journalName": "Journal of environmental management", "journalVolume": "91 12", "journalPages": "\n          2632-8\n        ", "doi": "10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.07.039", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.07.039", "pmid": "20696516", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business", "Medicine"], "magId": "2080099320", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

It is estimated that the 'hidden' economy now comprises the bulk of economic activity.", "authors": [{"name": "Mohammed  Salisu", "ids": ["8812790"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["fcd61d1f9861b681755986d951e380978c09fa4a", "8b0ad4b58ba9f4c855abda13ad575ea15d5b9181", "92e68d3fcc8b57966541a541866b3cd0b91c7491", "3fdfc337e9fa45ee688a2216fb8dab7281157692", "1cb788fa2001991a2a8b15e7aa8c35c8e45e4896", "5f99d547e167b1ba1f9e84d4f68c7d319c6808e5", "f444139ddd9afb37c4eac48b63174529816ab8dc", "1f9020c439c1d591d09f17e6614b4cea89979863", "8abe3fd416e0b36583bace03c8d300be675d02f9", "028fd04e7b72e8f83f1aacb5ad067f2b3d73043c", "64a1bea370dba760864ecb216ade4e8425a019e8", "2684d6038ad6d44071d8018b20bffae630cde643", "aecb8c37499a4cbd380826392a787697289f3816", "9376b42aa6bbcb53d2753c3735eb078eb361829d", "9aa96ab6a347d3bbe3c5027bd08ea7fd533c5406", "6eec741aa05bc6696c0c2d2134fff545d7bcfa1a", "8c79a7c856c2bfa7b4c91f2576c876fa9beeda55", "93ea2ad0dda7351eeda44c922c1c8d887dbabef5", "d9083a79675f4c155f1b2fe8ae096fb3387cd077", "d49fa172ccab2b4e8ca3f1e2e2403715b6ae3d27", "9f5d0a822b560be0782cf4d381fe5e20ec9b9d2a", "adacbd1b811c1129dbe25c71eb3f0b83b5daeca9", "1fdadda6938d47395a9818bcc75801ce310ba7a1", "5aebfa38de5337bae5c766c92a2a9aa36dcced83", "7b4878ba2531f6b8222590b0362fd6fdc33f4d49"], "outCitations": ["5fddcc9dbd79d9e6aeee37ba029aba2fac1b49f1", "c63a3760702b535eb4f448ea207ce5c681d254a0", "9a3a9b1e2ce8fff7515cb984ff8730451cf934c7", "db75d8d10c971e4b561d4d8427ed53e6bd571d74", "b47f3d879f1da7b18f9bd460feca7acd81c2ca05", "ad60a8e28108704a7a18c72ef1f8c57805090511", "ee04feb580892aae013f83e935a432c246f0d9d8", "5a00b63691cf8f25e459881fcbf680bed52cb9aa", "2a62d51e851805881fe39f2ddf4d71c997dea9cf", "29b0d22cecdacc1aeb54c6050981de5310beb292", "72bfd2160f301c14b2559acccebb1d1f5087785e", "d261eabb17c4d4bc85f274e8638f49f80011a059", "95560085f16dfe9b556d0eea424ef4f7977fb647", "cb5784bbb8ee385a74d69bd12040ba26e7884583", "ea87f4e8aab05fe82cca13af211786111eb6f36e", "f26fa747f4081402fb6d00e7b981b35adbde4a42", "67d30acdf00b9fe230ba290f4b1e001ef042ff5b", "e243d514c9accfee21f95e5c3f5f87fd3f045d13", "fed0061666a5c05156acf174b9132b58eeab52f6", "3e408bb52acb80047317d0adf6b94cdb94a0933a", "2c4055283b47e1d076f1eb7480674d56cd82987d", "dbc433ac4ad9d8e24c9dc8186ce33ec79404cef4", "fc5b47ab95b63e17f497ac971909ea9e23b36ca3", "0b25a4e6f04b1ef659b8297d13dc2a934b3e1e87", "7a5814f6084c2723fe0315a3c983baeeed5700a7", "2f8d04619196aef43631a38d4e7ba5779cd28ae3", "7c8f6b1106be623546cdd24cc98b53222f93053a", "caa321e85af7756e7ade00959d64188538ecfdbd"], "year": 2001, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a6157faea145bd65437ca6a74d2c948be95c290c", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/dp2001-86.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "1547798665", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Our study addresses this gap by focusing on low-tech industries, and on the food one in particular by exploring if and how open innovation is implemented by food companies. Drawing on a database collected from food firms operating in Italy and adopting quantitative techniques, we investigate the implementation strategies of the open innovation paradigm, conscious that food companies are adopting an open approach to innovation. Results show that they mainly implement two different strategies, according to different sets of drivers and enabling factors. These strategies should be referred to with the terms \u201copen market pull\u201d and \u201copen technology push\u201d.", "authors": [{"name": "Francesco  Galati", "ids": ["40355983"],

{"id": "662cbe3d9fec0f766b2db8dbb810d986624f0526", "title": "Policies and instruments affecting water use for bioenergy production", "paperAbstract": "Bioenergy related water use intensifies existing water stress, increasing the importance of sustainable management of water resources for sustainable bioenergy production and use. This paper discusses policies and instruments of importance for water use for bioenergy production, considering both biomass production and the subsequent conversion to solid/liquid/gaseous fuels and electricity. Water policies on the biomass production side should focus on ensuring efficient water use. While environmental policy instruments such as command-and-control approaches support maintaining specific water quantities and quality standards for biofuel production, market-based tools can help users to identify least-cost options for biofuel operation. For the energy conversion side, water quality is the key issue that needs to be addressed with adequate policy instruments. Finally, the evaluation of water-use policies and instruments for bioenergy production should not only relate to their direct impacts on water use, but should take into account overall impacts on the economy.", "authors": [{"name": "M\u00e1rcia Maria Guedes Alcoforado de Moraes", "ids": ["145659926"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Claudia  Ringler", "ids": ["5945870"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Ximing  Cai", "ids": ["33970674"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["99dfae7af1dace7513dac659e5a346466c03a970", "11fd3854f208d35296a3d0d53cfe1c64a223cb83", "f31df8e80dc244a9ca7dc4d9b3cf03f081c87d56", "3031e8149c4a47fd3ae5751a027b4323610a6db2", "c690b1b8e9ed794ad54b29b2d3dcadadff279a89", "17aac8b67ed425b853d943df526d30e88730b5a7", "8836fb81f97711288c140eda4b4bb58b4173be17", "ae5abba41af615459afe505b5cd45f9a0442fc8b", "e3168e13dd420cf19dec09243f4001dc6c813431", "3f3c9cb82e08498e90e9125bba85ca7612b3d152", "dabbfa86acb85aba26962db74f4cf4181868d36e", "03ea012921a5d04661e44a306610936f07ffa0c9", "23e1ac5ea0ab453bbde3ca9101a82b4aee1e92a5", "b1a1259847a61d0f71f756938754c27cdb6d773d", "f36c0bf2a6ea71a10faeb1e6f859d1a9a6e65f3a", "e4f69e0afa5a7a71d1f30df2ff382cac66ea7432", "81df62f3856c26129ff81ddfee5301aab0584e1b", "6f4de742f6324db67f1d7a1f6b481a3fe1612f3c", "d80943f45509243b515eea8137af16c6d686d88a", "639b278235278d7478834bbc18e7e37f7cd08506"], "outCitations": ["1aa9405a69dc1c86467ab549c47bc15c286d6398", "0b0d9e3fa44139b05afeb898f056afcd84a00db7", "c98388f5efd9acaba631097b6db60152073d02dd", "c3bb5bb30ab2e5f3935a446d5a7aada85dee69c4", "b1806641564964abc18986c142abc9b5bbf965a2", "520371d0a6707fd8baa7c568fcee8f52ae4e5640", "d46ea19418a236b940f1037c50a8902ed1c59e18", "f906d9ae1d44d67a3b22fb72067210dc181b895f", "c6ba56fc1b18509ada95f4b046a91e3316d1066d", "faed4bd4e8539118fd4604dbd0e34877c04c39d8", "c91da77a2e9964734cb9aeb96e0bf21359878d4e", "4160a66e0da25edf648b165dc30a2147ae9194eb", "18a1391ba721465b00e4d631af5ac9743053a46b", "89096b8af83f03ec1f32877635640998870a0f7f", "87c9a8c874bd72333940baa7de19c49349bc9e6d", "1c43fea8de9aef579775ffcc7ca72b6f6af5fb1d", "b8416d55d9324a889e1645a906c3adf902bd27a9", "b97e26fdaab08a1248571d25070fbbbaedc2b279", "89f15bead212c352b6e1c9a2f4e6065f3073205e", "12b60b24f911c481db9fcaa08d0d58665143e8f2", "f9d8cb74579ea0310f99e439e211eed443267adf", "bf5547e895500258233f912b239f39496daafcfb", "9f7c3369426885081a96d95d244de37ff8d13908", "cbdf53f77317c8ae17d0b61ebffadd204e65cddf", "ded3f0791dad1d5c0a4ac939c7f7d6299df39338", "15b44f96c6dbb1b0d91fd334666d9290d890aa56", "0e77dd1498aef9e46ec8a68283303b47f1fd1365", "8bdb5db242c56f2098df5903b5fab5f4ca9eb2e3", "c296f26996d15b4b1f7a9b7498674fb5b189d5ff", "686c1cf8f0a9c6b01a3672c0b67812a20126db3f", "911cfd8f8ef858b8a8f852efb5fa1ca22e064b3d", "0ba73caa7f71fe4846c3eb015f6c83cf36f09a43", "0512a02e577227b1bb95d073f01025cb875649a4", "898747360d3313fa733ff2a1989bf48e455f35a7", "c99b37f5445dfe1e206d5a9e7be7bdce9bcebd55", "6021f48a5e324e6b0e9d622d474049f65689be7f", "496d63e18b741555bb95fd4ceb9e6f9abb9b6113", "76ed104261e4eec8bf40116b11309b676e04eea4", "99e4dd18145c58371eddb7e5d818daf223b8fc6a", "2cc5c426e353f32ebaccf76d255b44e0aa31967a", "b87c9cacef88cecdaf3b410c42bde3e3cb7012ab", "255f257f101d372a90cdd8e39ac8926ca816c58e", "cba6b6c5b9c2043c92981b725f8494e74e4af32a", "9158caa93d7d28e003a05c3ef5810fd7c6f2e023", "5a4460065039e60b6d72e0b314ab6dc618678bda", "b8ef01f5bf7126b8dc131b827bdbcf91abc56d14", "e38b46d8f1a4f9421be6fa64e66b177d7f76fb58", "f1f7964241c12d4c55e2c46195791c115f754080", "d13abd334c2af168433993ee1749268489130b02", "fe82dfad8bb6028cdef4b50ec085178f0e6f382e", "b368480d7a27207c04451ffe0a0241c27465ea02", "af3e5fd8a3accd8ff75790a5411dffa98cc6be34", "76e1c725d92acd46c01d44217897559d5d4df00c"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/662cbe3d9fec0f766b2db8dbb810d986624f0526", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://iwra.org/member/congress/resource/PAP00-6088.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining", "journalVolume": "5", "journalPages": "431-444", "doi": "10.1002/BBB.306", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1002/BBB.306", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2134237195", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Credit access is indeed an important aspect of informal businesses, as it enables intertemporal decisions, such as investment as well as income and consumption smoothing, and it offers HBs a means to bear shocks. In a fluctuating economic and institutional context, where insurance mechanisms are often inexistent or incomplete, accessing credit may thus be an important determinant of economic performance. However, due to their small size, their lack of collateral or their informal character, many HBs are likely to remain excluded from the main credit channels provided by commercial banks, and they are forced to rely on expensive informal creditsuppliers, on their business partners or on their friends and relatives to access liquidity.Different types of lenders coexist in Vietnam\u2019s credit market: formal credit institutions that are regulated by the state such as banks, microfinance institutions (MFI), mass organisations and informal credit institutions that are unlicensed (e.g. friends and family, customers and suppliers, usurers and other types of lenders). As other studies on Vietnam have suggested, these suppliers are quite dynamic and offer a plurality of products (differing in average value lent, the collateral requirements, the interest rate and the duration of the loan) that the person applying for credit can access depending on his or her characteristics and needs. The significant presence of informal credit as a source of funding shows that formal lenders cannot adequately meet the demand of every HB.On the demand side, different profiles of HBs are present on the market and they differ in their needs and access, and some appear to be more constrained than others. Using the rich information on the topic contained in the 2014/15 HB&IS survey, this chapter characterizes the credit market by examining both the supply and the demand,and by analysing the extent and determinants of credit constraints. This chapter estimates that larger household businesses whose owners have greater human and social capital tend be less credit constrained. The rationing of credit by formal institutions, due mostly to their inefficiency, does not adequately meet the credit demand, leaving some HBs rejected or self-rejected from the credit market. Those HBs cannot provide enough guaranties for commercial banks, are not targeted by MFIs and do not have the required social capital to overcome asymmetry of information when applying for informal loans.This chapter is organised as follows: After presenting and describing the main lenders and the characteristics of the loans they offer in section 1, we examine the demand for credit among HBs. In the last part of this chapter we analyse the extent and determinants of credit rationing among HBs.", "authors": [{"name": "Camille Saint Macary", "ids": ["104713966"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Yoann  Lamballe", "ids": ["119675039"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2017, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/63dc2a7ac06dc561e05720150726c54abcc49e98", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2904947685", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

More often than not, the consequences of resettlement will have an impact on two different communities; the community which is being relocated (displaced community) and the community receiving the newly relocated community (host community). For example, social disintegration and severe impoverishment are some of the immediate consequences of resettlements, which affect not only the displaced community but also the host community. As these negative consequences are more than likely to demand resource sharing, it is not unusual that the host community often blames the displaced communities for creating economic losses and social unease. Therefore, receiving community\u2019s acceptance to host the new community is essential to ensure integration and to sustain the resettlement, if the repatriation is not possible for the new community. Accordingly, this paper aims to identify the influences of acceptance between the displaced and the host communities. \nA comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify acceptance factors and to draw conclusions. Results show that segregation and labelling, differences in land use pattern, inadequate resources to share, the growth of an informal economy, lack of improvement in public services to the population increase, and cultural barriers are some of the factors influencing the acceptance of the host community. However, the significance of these factors is highly dependent on several background factors such as the wealth of the host community, nature of government policies, livelihood of the host community, and alike. Understandably, the difficulty in establishing an empirically verifiable list of factors affecting the acceptance / rejection between the host and the displaced communities may be attributed to the fact that these factors may stem from latent variables. Therefore, an empirical study based on the identified factors is recommended for future research to determine the latent variables.", "authors": [{"name": "Pournima  Sridarran", "ids": ["101547146"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Kaushal  Keraminiyage", "ids": ["68999498"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Nishara  Fernando", "ids": ["31924008"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["112387a1fe4a2e67922e23ebe12b2eb83860d139", "ace1681fbbfcc46e94025c5645dc22644c729eda", "16147aa60d95a26599a1b28ca00e5a5f20685faa", "3fb189eb8bc0bb5f24aa390054e7a1fa68a91961", "c7a89abe869969dc78c773e563a32fc02aeca38f", "5a57024fb62d3b6debb662f022546e041c57a4ab", "d06b5ad99651a0ef583f420f9aef04692e334cee"], "outCitations": ["e2bafcd8b84342dfb4471d376af1d31101924907", "c8001af1d50ed261981aee1eddfd54631d8e7fa6", "c6389ab932e3c9537057e47aaa14c9679d567237", "8eea2dccf50461f48e802a18c0efdadae67b3fac", "3410cbfe97efda452d24d363e83cfc3bdb3bec67", "5b19fcc13cdbbfb2a0ef54df8222b725dd837e21", "13353c1ecfa624d008981458ac80607c945bb4ff", "408ca8797e3737f2c0b354f20d95942a2d56a3fa", "acefeb0d2038dace9e86c86d73496a2e408b7960", "f018559aba70cc1828bb636de217639d776d5e52", "bb9c8b6b0f3b1000f36601f055f5e47a0732851d", "afaefa8f1b1601ea9ec9c95f20992299629a3701", "6059110217da4bd23d309241f09f28a115620acf", "c6097e32c56c567ea13e5859f8e4693cc7c4a8d0", "83ef5bc4b5ee083c4164b5427f5793f8c93772a8", "9ebd7e59cba2c8e947e25606d195b2db99f1ad25", "81e1ed905705c2dd74cd9d8b15ce9fe9b7c09c91", "7c27a471355a2f9f72dc8a0f8696948c216f6fe3", "a3dc249e65abe48ff728803031c035bb2d38d69c", "9f7aeda62b20438a2d726445cf709fec135df6a0", "d22e857d71a72c6901d9ee92fedada0a831985c9", "3d87568c738fcc8cd9bca5f037cacff61660c07d"], "year": 2018, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6ef7da963bdba6855f300a2ff4cc8dfba2b701e7", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/120784.pdf", "http://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/49883/1/1-s2.0-S1877705818301474-main.pdf", "https://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/120784.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Procedia Engineering", "journalVolume": "212", "journalPages": "962-969", "doi": "10.1016/J.PROENG.2018.01.124", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1016/J.PROENG.2018.01.124", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2793483060", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Good Luck!", "paperAbstract": "With the passage of the Drug Price Competition Act of 1984 in the United States, the recent German Supreme Court decision allowing for experimental use of patented pharmaceuticals, and indirectly through the adoption of the Supplemental Protection Certificate in Europe, Japan seems to be the lone large pharmaceutical market which does not allow in some way for the experimental use of patented drugs to gain regulatory approval for a generic equivalent. Japanese generic pharmaceutical manufacturers had, until recently, operated under the assumption that the testing of a generic equivalent to a patented drug to gain regulatory approval was allowable as long as the drug was not marketed until after the patent had expired. This assumption proved incorrect in a recent Nagoya District Court decision, which essentially relied on the logic of an earlier decision to find that pre-patent experimental use for commercial exploitation is not allowable under the Japanese Patent Law. However, with Japan's society graying more rapidly than many other industrialized nations, the Ministry of Health and Welfare has taken a hard look at generic pharmaceuticals as a mechanism for reducing health-care costs. The favorable view that generic pharmaceuticals are receiving from the Ministry of Health and Welfare combined with the move toward greater transparency between the government and industry leads to the logical conclusion that the Ministry of Health and Welfare, through the Diet, will likely propose a change to the Japanese Patent Law which would allow for the pre-patent expiry testing of generic pharmaceutical equivalents. While there are drawbacks to such an experimental use doctrine, the long term benefits are many. From helping a Yenconscious government reduce health-care costs to bolstering domestic pharmaceutical innovation by fostering greater competition, an experimental use allowance for generic pharmaceuticals is right for Japan.", "authors": [{"name": "William T Christiansen", "ids": ["144803530"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["7a52086109c6d991e32129a02bd760e28466b0c8", "a1d729c858b9dafcc82252a0304de5882756a037"], "outCitations": [], "year": 1997, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/163c47a48d39bc1b5d508d67799c701b54d9b413", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://digitalcommons.law.uw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1128&context=wilj", "https://digital.lib.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/899/6PacRimLPolyJ613.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics", "Business"], "magId": "2270054064", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

The instrument described in this paper, is an example of this shift which gives to accessibility measures a central role in transport and urban planning. \nSuch accessibility instruments have been developed both for scientific and planning motivations. In the academic field the important role of transport infrastructures for spatial development is well recognized: areas with better access to the locations of input materials and markets will be more productive, more competitive and hence more attractive than remote and isolated areas (Linneker, 1997). However, the impact of transport infrastructures on spatial development has been difficult to be verified empirically; in fact, modelling analysis, such as those based on accessibility measures, is necessary to investigate these impacts and to analyse the effects of transport infrastructure and service improvements on the spatial distribution patterns. In other words, the scientific question the accessibility instrument here presented, wants to answer is \u201cwhat are the impacts on the land use induced by changes in the transportation system?\u201d \nThe scientific question has direct implications for planning, related to the distributive issues of transport interventions: the goal of the accessibility instrument is to assess and to value the benefits of changes in either the land-use or the transportation systems, as a performance indicator of integrated land-use and transport planning. In other words, the question the instrument wants to address is \u201cwho reaps the accessibility benefits from investments in the transport system and where are these located?\u201d", "authors": [{"name": "Enrica  Papa", "ids": ["67068143"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Pierluigi  Coppola", "ids": ["39949338"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["634fa89aa554e9ddb0aa64e2dd3d62023a142b1c", "1266e4310c21b2180280193b04cb2efd9b381b84", "8a87c0004c57378f0022537cc6b7d970874838b6", "ab98849219bb27ba78e158a09620f10da99c3ebe", "c4c4a4457b6e0b2d55a12ecedead1b0927b4468c", "041d7d4408f7e808d0eb6bff3b07e1045a61b3db", "359995271dc7f3e885c0ce31649884c0424803fd", "887143e724864933a7841f0e13efc0ad3cf865e2", "58964898c1e8daea184a3b2366a327259a85cd7d", "ad92e94f28e59f565b932fd4cce27068001d2fd0", "962b47223dcb36d0892c16a1be0c384d0bbfab00", "b733cf321269a01360ff5be73309347a0bacd1da", "10ea1896605e3ce5207e9b006e28c42b540da60d", "074375c0257ba784f24a99fe3ed0c15156a04652", "e30979df07adf61cea5f0809950abf5b0c30cb32", "9a78b99613752b4d4b54ffbfe754deae05086c9e", "11cd6deae39e1730ce991c123ed171724f301d9a"], "outCitations": ["189d4933061a9473c356d39b313fdf0388ecc564", "f76586caa5080540eb8306250f49c3a16a725e51", "58c42912df9d78a498c52c22c504250aaed59ff7", "0f630c2f47a7e3ca267d7be3eb3fe20296616ab8", "c174dcdad1c79a4a2dd8818666c87dba51af34fc", "8c7d1af27aa695f7a2ae0eed13d15bc6378177c6", "a4dff2b7b5bd828b8b20ab2ec497885b8732fe11", "acb86fa4be2331e0c534734b3f1c9150bc4db661", "34f292a44f31a83958dfc2dad784a3bf3f53a002"], "year": 2012, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4a5ab2c825341784623bc08cc2d179608ebfcf11", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.accessibilityplanning.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/11-GraBAM-R.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "117-124", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2792056798", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Only a bit - and they could bite", "paperAbstract": "Touted as an important commitment device that attracts foreign investors, the number of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) ratified by developing countries has grown dramatically. The author tests empirically whether BITs have actually had an important role in increasing the foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to signatory countries. While half of OECD FDI into developing countries by 2000 was covered by a BIT, this increase is accounted for by additional country pairs entering into agreements rather than signatory hosts gaining significant additional FDI. The results also indicate that such treaties act more as complements than as substitutes for good institutional quality and local property rights, the rationale often cited by developing countries for ratifying BITs. The relevance of these findings is heightened not only by the proliferation of such treaties, but by recent high profile legal cases. These cases show that the rights given to foreign investors may not only exceed those enjoyed by domestic investors, but expose policymakers to potentially large-scale liabilities and curtail the feasibility of different reform options. Formalizing relationships and protecting against dynamic inconsistency problems are still important, but the results should caution policymakers to look closely at the terms of agreements.",

Understanding the properties of traditionally fermented dairy products as well as a proper analysis of the indigenous processing steps are important in order to recommend appropriate manufacturing protocol and procedures for commercialization. Little information is available on the general characteristics and processing practices of traditional dairy products of Ethiopia. Therefore, the objective of this review was to critically assess and summarize information on indigenous fermented dairy products of the country. The traditional dairy products included in this review are ergo (spontaneously fermented milk), ititu (spontaneously fermented milk curd), kibe (traditional butter), neter kibe (ghee), dhanaan (Ethiopian fermented camel milk), ayib (Ethiopian cottage cheese), hazo (spiced fermented buttermilk), arera (defatted sour milk) and aguat (acid whey). The indigenous dairy products have good nutritional and functional potential to scale up to commercial production.

The latest IUS indicators for Croatia show the slowing of innovation activity due to prolonged recession circumstances and point to the risk of regressing into the modest innovator group. So far innovation process determinants in Croatia have been researched on the national level alone (Radas and Bo\u017eic, 2009). Given the fact that indicators of innovation activity have regressed in the Age of Austerity, a detailed assessment of innovation determinants on the regional level provides an additional insight into interrelatedness of the innovation processes and performance. Using NUTS 2 level classification that was valid up to 2013, we found statistically significant differences in innovation performance among three Croatian regions by using analysis of variance (ANOVA) on a sample of 3.404 innovative firms in the period 2006-2008 and 3.390 innovative firms in the period 2008-2010. The innovation performance of Northwest Croatia is superior across various types of innovation. These findings can be explained with Northwest Croatia\u2019s technological structure of industries that is more technology- and knowledge-intensive than in the other two regions, thus contributing to the more competitive international position of firms. Within-firm factors were also found important, attributing more to regions with larger firms and higher number of employees with university degree. The paper aims at providing relevant research findings for the configuration of national innovation system and for national innovation policy.", "authors": [{"name": "Katarina  Ba\u010di\u0107", "ids": ["31284008"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Zoran  Aralica", "ids": ["97683013"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2014, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4aeb04734925306df2f6b05cd1f32ffb97f696aa", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2796233046", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

{"id": "c5684df2d2cf0d57ff4c549ca18c9f5b86486863", "title": "Moving Fast: Competition Heats Up on Credit Card Security", "paperAbstract": "As everyone knows, the recent downturn in the dot-com world has hit the stock market, especially the NASDAQ, hard lately. Does that mean a corresponding slowdown in credit card purchases over the Internet? Hardly, if you can believe the analysts. According to one report, online use of credit cards is growing at over 50% a year in the United States and Internet spending will top $25 billion in 2001. Yet Internet credit card use has a long way to go, and while consumers increasingly want to shop online, many are reluctant to provide credit card details on the Internet, scared stiff that someone will obtain the information and use it to make fraudulent purchases. One company that has worked hand in hand with the banking industry for over 88 years is NewGround Resources. President/CEO Kevin Blair notes, \"We see virtually of all of our client banks working diligently to address security issues. We work closely with our customers to help them stay current on not only credit card and Internet Home Banking security advances, but across-the-board security trends including such issues as physical security and employee training.\" American Express is one company that is taking steps to allay consumer fears of Internet-based credit card fraud by rolling out one-time-use credit card numbers. These \"disposable\" credit card numbers are linked to their physical American Express cards--simply download Private Payments software or visit American Express online, enter your username and password, and you'll get your new randomly generated number. This is a good first step, but Amex's solution is not practical for everything. Fortunately, one-time--or surrogate--credit card numbers appear to have more potential than this first-generation deployment of Private Payments. One major advantage to surrogate number technology is that it doesn't require merchants or consumers to add any hardware. The randomly generated numbers mimic the consumer's actual account number, making them virtually indiscernible to the merchant. Furthermore, surrogate numbers should add less than 400 milliseconds to the authorization process, still keeping most processing times around five seconds--great news since no one wants transactions to become slower or more expensive. American Express's Private Payments doesn't require special hardware or transaction costs either, so why not use Amex's system? One good reason is that Private Payments doesn't work for one-click purchases using stored credit card numbers and shipping information. It's also impractical for replenishing groceries or office supplies delivered at preset intervals. Another situation in which it is useless is when Internet service providers (ISPs) ask to store customer credit card information for automatic monthly billing purposes. Advanced forms of the technology will allow consumers to set up merchant accounts and control the length and amount of authorization, which basically creates a set of spending rules designed to prevent fraudulent use. Other features may include integrated e-wallet capabilities, graphical elements such as a visual of the issuer-branded card, and the ability to code authorization for purchase categories (food, office supplies, etc.). The success of surrogate number technology is also somewhat linked to the obstacles facing \"smart cards.\" Surrogate number technology and smart cards both offer solutions to the online fraud concerns of consumers. However, some analysts believe that surrogate numbers will have a faster adoption rate than smart cards simply because merchants are already equipped to handle them so resistance should be basically nonexistent. Consumers want a solution to fraud, and many aren't easily appeased by zero liability promises. Surrogate number technology realistically addresses the problem of online fraud and should help provide the means to easily and painlessly help the public do its part in fighting credit card abuse and fraud. \u2026", "authors": [{"name": "Kevin  Blair", "ids": ["67137716"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["3a2cd9b68e464bf56762965062d27a745ef6664a", "4297203990f13429a43bf0c526224a7902405577"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2001, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c5684df2d2cf0d57ff4c549ca18c9f5b86486863", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "ABA Banking Journal", "journalVolume": "93", "journalPages": "63", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "293147831", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

People with a western life-style travel frequently and over longer distances, hence tourism is becoming increasingly international. At the same time international migration also increases, especially from the South to the North. This paper puts focus on the socio-spatial labor mobility in (and out of) tourism and hospitality. Tourism and hospitality are widely thought to be highly feminized sectors. Jobs are considered low paid, temporary and/or part-time, low skilled and with few career opportunities. What is more, staff turnover is high. However, tourism and hospitality is sometimes claimed to be gateways for immigrants and young people to enter the labor market. Moreover, in deindustrializing and in sparsely populated, rural regions, expectations of tourism and hospitality as remedies to rising unemployment are high. This paper suggests a study of labor and the socio-spatial labor mobility in tourism and hospitality from an intersectional perspective (gender, race, class) and in two different geographical settings: the urban and the rural. What patterns of socio-spatial labour (im)mobility can be discovered? What patterns of division of labor in each context (urban/rural)? This paper also suggests that work performed by front-end workers in tourism and hospitality could be labeled \u201creproductive\u201d.

However, rice production in Senegal only meet 20% of the domestic demand largely due to the poor performance of rice farmers and low productivity. Access to agricultural credit has strong impacts on the technical efficiency of farmers and would promote inputs and new technology adoption. But that is not clear enough in previous studies. This study investigates the impact of agricultural credit access on rice productivity and technical efficiency with 260 random sampled rice farmers from Anambe basin in Senegal. The Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) was adopted to estimate the technical efficiency. The results indicate that the inputs of rice production, including labor, pesticide, herbicides and fertilizer, have significant impacts on rice productivity. Furthermore, the results present that the average efficiency is of 0.813 and the inefficiency estimation model reveals that the influences of agricultural credit access, gender, education, ethnicity, use of improved seed and land tenure system on technical inefficiency of rice production are significant. Particularly, for the access to agricultural credit, rice farmers without agricultural credit would get 3.8% higher production inefficiency. The farmers with access to credit yield 37.32% higher rice production than their counterparts. Therefore, our study provides strong empirical evidence to promote agricultural credit in rice production.", "authors": [{"name": "Mouhamadou Foula Diallo", "ids": ["1492043940"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Jiajun  Zhou", "ids": ["1483802027"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Hamidullah  Elham", "ids": ["1580966006"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "De  Zhou", "ids": ["2143559185"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["ee3399e8c9df500fbf9b6cba70d2ce3edcec83e9", "3ec9c6675c2ccd868fed3f25db41fc8894b318a2", "03d1e71e823e0a6423637f675061231dbb1d65ad", "095fcf30753d64358368e14ae83b1cadaaf32bda", "071f211ee4799ea191743cc893496ce4e098cdcc", "708b5f52e2f90a4a69c47f2423b2591bc2f3064b", "832d6c4b6eb04944c2a98591a4d243e44b3bd9dc", "59ee9acbbfc4ba03d5a08ca70dec3b63215b29de", "a243aa14ad896a2857b3e32d4b75a29993d32491", "2e9dc193a00cd15681e92fad3b4de9d5b9a09faf", "08d17a69b3b1d383134f517bb616be6cadf171c0", "21c188bc96e13be57b3cbabbb33c9fcc846300b5", "a7d0a606fb1ca1164cd65fb0d825f7e3355cccba", "26e7f1ed4b3ab627e1533a6093579b00a3997492", "6dc5bdc77267f234d79424e1163a705f743dda52", "dc249aab8da41de7517f64a82dc62449fa07b0ca", "f87670345b876c3c8d54cdef51eb6ea30bcbb59d", "bd9718dcad029993799ba73c22dd92ee0f5eed03", "3d6ca6a699e579463e0b01526d9842d41f26b314", "3eef25fd2af656581206fb7fb7aa1b632fea9e3e"], "year": 2020, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b8093aacb13be647a9fa09e2ee3864d063eec7e8", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jas/article/download/0/0/42015/43707"], "venue": "", "journalName": "The Journal of Agricultural Science", "journalVolume": "12", "journalPages": "78", "doi": "10.5539/jas.v12n3p78", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.5539/jas.v12n3p78", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3006108829", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

As health systems grow, like any business, they are forced to explore standardization to realize and maintain efficient practices. Clinical services, such as laboratory medicine, are more difficult to integrate due to wider variation in acceptable practice and culture, compared with other services. However, changes to laboratory service are imperative if health care professionals expect to survive and thrive in the new business environment. In this article, I describe the advocation efforts of the System Laboratory Council group toward implementation of a standardization process that we call integration, to improve the efficiency of the Laboratory Services department of our health system, the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS).", "authors": [{"name": "Jim  Cook", "ids": ["2115138981"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["d085b7248146642798b9b048682fae0630bb925a"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2017, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e610932141c45471be0d0058966f89599ceaedb0", "sources": ["Medline"], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "Laboratory medicine", "journalName": "Laboratory medicine", "journalVolume": "48 3", "journalPages": "\n          e43-e52\n        ", "doi": "10.1093/labmed/lmw069", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1093/labmed%2Flmw069", "pmid": "28525630", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business", "Medicine"], "magId": "2616814007", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

An organizational-level Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) reveals that private organizations exhibit significantly more activities across three learning organization dimensions: psychological safety, education and training, and knowledge transfer. Employees in private organizations\u2013especially in the finance and banking sector\u2013perceive a higher level of psychological safety under a supportive learning climate and environment. Additionally, the natures of business organizations\u2013production, construction, and real estate\u2013exhibit a higher level of concrete learning practices and reflection on work processes. Furthermore, the number of employees affects the process of analytical thinking within organizations. There were statistically significant interaction effects among organization sectors, the nature of business, and number of employees on the sub-dimension, psychological safety in the workplace.

This happens because most users find strong answers to security questions difficult to remember. Previous research in security education was successful in motivating users to change their behaviour towards security issues, through the use of serious games (i.e. games designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment). Hence, in this paper we evaluate the design of a serious game, to investigate the features and functionalities that users would find desirable in a game that aims to educate them to provide strong and memorable answers to security questions. Our findings reveal that: (1) even for security education games, rewards seem to motivate users to have a better learning experience; (2) functionalities which contain a social element (e.g. getting help from other players) do not seem appropriate for serious games related to security questions, because users fear that their acquaintances could gain access to their security questions; (3) even users who do not usually play games would seem to prefer to play security education games on a mobile device.", "authors": [{"name": "Nicholas  Micallef", "ids": ["2331658"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Nalin Asanka Gamagedara Arachchilage", "ids": ["2991616"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["ea2c0ad33e2ea5ba9cdb4462cd2d0fb0a97bc959", "5fa852bf59353efb77a66617fafd6e2b40df7f22", "2140ec717761a7dd5670b8f3272b999c6134dd1b", "408a79544d579eedca5282191a39906da19a9fd3", "0d5dfe6c5bcf43406f9274e6ca44ca2c3b9bc202", "15e74bbdbe92ae034b81520c4a217a8c1140c05a", "0e11fe2bcc96e4e1c43afccfd4005ab43ccbf020", "8f41c334083d58a151a290308a70f2d81c5ece12"], "outCitations": ["4bcdcdf5ea55964bf851ae273d14ac06a8bc5726", "9b2848730ac8619bd18d774437bce14b7b85702f", "6fd23ac809b85ba04734bdeca5013088a13e83fb", "56c16d9e2a5270ba6b1d83271e2c10916591968d", "79596de8da82cbb219e88b45c808b052606f765d", "da9b26490f6f844a98806ed350b19f74067524e9", "4a44522cd6a2b82f63bff2a28077c4da5e665345", "3399f83ff6149dc65b52600f52ed372be5a6aa86", "6282513397971153b7f3c20787982f54f452655f", "c322efc6da30b8c705e463f4e3a3df43a98039b7", "a57314c5d55da3c9a365fb1181810a9a87e3864e", "1f28cbb9f9bad7ac49d2af4c3cd3f118397d106b", "ccd329b41914b40c571f2fcf1761c2b4f90887bf", "a5831453f70db8feb8a80581acfbebc0f1b033aa", "774a7aadf5f26348309887a43893bbd6576a209c", "5aded0dbd79ce76d42e18b8dd8254fa7edf2dedd", "1b00efd6cd4576129c980793cfd850becfc765b8", "ea8b799498a4ce45d57f31191af338a4ab4eb325", "305b05758e24c88f13b9fd97ea64764022675efd", "4ee237d215c41374cb94227a44d1a51af7d3873f", "ec595b50d1d457f9c44c3084eb18955845a71d92", "7ca9b14fcfd944192dccba2bd998c3c1f3bcb8ed", "d8ee2253c14c2f3eb48cdcbaaa242425a1f53584", "3716902eb894dc5bfa5d8e5ce908d566fd434c35", "0e54689fe0a3559219b0f38a79ce8dae50282f1c", "c80d57a83b1151fc6b35591d417040c2454a991b", "88c89fbffbf9e14e3b82cceab14408c6d368d59c", "72a938200f952bbc61c0bb231cbe4d9794b1a0f0", "c15caa9b6c0d1fa10daf93b1976fe0b6144c0588", "8ad9801baea65b40fbbe6fc56e34b2b7be47d0ba", "ced5b334ba2be0a439ce2fddaee2cf25da5ebcc9", "db355d4564cfe8fd4f55262c7cdbaec96ec60a8e", "0bbc7559ac219b7d27523b84a89b2d3e8ba09264", "58ce57b64702843e92f817dbbc1c636e2fcad3e0"], "year": 2017, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0c4f462d61ae15d8536af8115161f689156e8c95", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.cscan.org/openaccess/?paperid=348", "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03888v1.pdf", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03888", "https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03888"], "venue": "HAISA", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "177-187", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Business"], "magId": "2761255832", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}
{"id": "aef775adca9e4f04f0eba30b26878fe6a87c2b85", "title": "The perfect match? 100 reasons why energy cooperation is not realized in industrial parks", "paperAbstract": "Abstract Industrial energy cooperation and joint energy services can enhance primary energy efficiency and stimulate competitiveness of involved companies. From a theoretical and fully informed point of view, often two or more companies seem a perfect match for cooperation. However, manifold and heterogeneous barriers must be overcome on the way from the first information/idea to the successful implementation and operation of an energy cooperation. The intention of this paper is to identify and summarize as many barriers to industrial energy cooperation as possible, classify them and draw conclusions in order to allow an early identification of potential barriers, thus enabling the development of solutions. Sources are research projects, literature review, expert workshops and interviews with various companies located in industrial parks. It was found that implementation of all types of energy cooperation need to overcome various barriers from several disciplines, associated with different stages of the implementation process. We find that technical and economic barriers to energy cooperation are more or less the same as for measures in single companies. In addition to these, social and information barriers are those primarily hampering initialization and implementation of energy cooperation, especially at early stages: even the theoretically ideal energy cooperation implies efforts for initialization, exchanging information and keeping track during complex contract negotiations.", "authors": [{"name": "Valerie  Rodin", "ids": ["1658247512"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Simon  Moser", "ids": ["48130573"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["b751e27696cfbbf53390f6c9526d1959a7c5cd23", "8eefa80e11d8c800869b4b1ac75a0ecae511689e"], "outCitations": ["208bfcdb38503468557b175a06509c55c79ea8a2", "2b037f9912e8d64ae7d686d1f8262a60e373a596", "8062882095c3398f9d0141cd13d474e46f9206ac", "67f206128e2ccf0362b55351d5900a82464e196e", "dff2a66600b16439ee7f1809403562f66200aeeb", "d67d701e703f363266411d9cf35b2dd8a1964240", "a37d43ad0989dacb6304f6705cd4f0787f6986fd", "8223200e5deb54b66a04a8479d7a848acd58dce2", "c94c91c6d8b2cc9c8b8cc1b4b9212a6910f1a5b4", "cf9e6343ccc5b5e0d0ebeb19bcf83a6d66ed02ec", "3be208aee270b79121ef964151eea2a2024a3860", "5d121ad0f1791145bdebe7d9d5c09d46ce9cfb9f", "4199eac8f86ac2d9e431cefde486c30d78e582a6", "d362c8b5705bffcae56be91052902a7bf7a4134c", "3d88e23ed5c8bdec6022cf1f5c736db1ea49e13a", "6799bb87ea3edc7af7724ba5d4d61fa8c497d879", "bef869f28b6a81dea6a194759640132a326d2460", "db2671ac6a21aed16a9340d62f238867079fbc6d", "47b7af7948cb708ebf7f53b3c158b2dc7dcc0add", "ade50f7750b66af66408d7f98ba363dc50bf8265", "93daed0df77b4bc094441cd80331b43fb46040af", "513ae1de8ea3c7feea9dfced1eeda14517f5ca71", "f6cf73261e42ce7f12ab1b92b18adc7722423ea0", "6a24ce3da8662c766af9bdc2407e53e6a7d99416", "15467b3e552760ddd6598538c8dda3de60f334f5", "4145f8aebe27d2e9b1b0d26b8a82efb91f0f0c00", "1a5fdc68ba3eb4a8b61e2237401a8b0a813bb693", "07a0ce439e7c185d88037cc73c4bd38edc90c9fd", "f02ea9c4d9a7ca7040aeeb85c2a2f92643997df4", "7e8eb4590f5d07df56c4aae2723b95a5e733ae81", "b43b801fd5d6a2e2c14b16bc69fef88be56effdc", "5cf6ffbbd29a457fa69aa22c17639f686497b0af", "84dc19bf32be2875bc606258c798f2e6be6b2719", "bd20a3be93364b20188fdc850ccc03b597f5036b", "87f05772cc47a2220ac2b87fed704cd1d7224465", "649053af3e233c0efc8d555076c31ad20de9017f", "aef6294624e7bd066f2f8588c1d8ef8fee179ff7", "dd2326a99602ce2812c02d689160532d4fe69c98", "f0d3bd1968f79a594df883b9be99afe6d86dd29e", "bfba3c50c87c6f0d493b9b5d03b117a949b4e383", "4f76dd620c1d442616c7d05f1fd5ba8d698adee0", "d5e65447fe9329910561d8537e25532fae99d9a5", "da41e5ff913cd9d51048f09b7eba03dd6c22f3da", "28b19fe1e7a4dcb868e82f5755027c269f210162", "276ac113ed47b14415f8c453dd663d7ced89e42a", "579aee70fd8425870076455b609adcd043cf8e54", "4e23bb078be1aca83d7cb220e5f061e335157bec", "b016d062bb2e80465960569c9115874d2faa1efd", "1ac7fb153085008cf5742d892076a28578ea81dc", "72677368a6453ce75bf39a8502b0aa05510bd28d", "e350a85b7804cd5d30565480f47b755d0490988c", "af253fb578405fb491f588fbeb37d5b0c1e87c1d", "dc0a2c6fdeebab87cbca2ae95932bf7d836a140b", "1f333a921f02f8b468e23cfa6822c6e0f906dad2", "f28b33f652d57ac0edfac90e33c4eabf6bb3f6bd", "9a78144b8065a5a4f9a79d7ee3a3e6b79111ee62", "29801cb76c597d729c4433a528387852a910582a", "5b18832d4bf11434c7bdc4dcce310fef20221b10", "f95c43540d00952fbec35a386c9f12493c947c9c", "af7c209522b9cff4637126479ee4c30f2535f0b9", "bdba8500122a89a0d0d4b2c05911f53e2c9ac5e9", "bf188d96a19ed72be11318b4f71551af19e84636", "5be4fa53bd87b583e93f1f91d080ef288c8bcd8f", "53d66e10724fe49e0f056030e16cfb746f218b80", "480e24c8bc0e79dd1db59a4e57c0203b3055314b", "86d33bb4b977e534c6923eb3a50772531c11eefc", "5cb725422d91373a73dfbab5e2e7a695e4fddba0", "c684c398a51a97d50a71d6fdae780ac6738370a3"], "year": 2021, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aef775adca9e4f04f0eba30b26878fe6a87c2b85", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "Energy research and social science", "journalVolume": "74", "journalPages": "101964", "doi": "10.1016/J.ERSS.2021.101964", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ERSS.2021.101964", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3133958391", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

In fact, ecosystem services provide benefits, in terms of goods and services, both to people living in the mountains and to people living outside them. At the moment, these services are seriously threatened, and \u201ctheir global degradation is increasingly jeopardizing development goals\u201d(OECD, 2008). As a consequence, it is necessary to reverse this trend while, at the same time, meeting the increasing demands of and interests in such services.1 The focus of our study are the alpine forest ecosystems, which represent a fundamental resource for people living in mountain areas and for human society, in general.2 In fact, it is commonly known that forests nowadays fulfil several other functions, in addition to what has been perceived as their main function (the productive one). These functions include the protective function, the landscape and recreational function and the ecological function.

Three main issues have been identified that are relevant to this strategy,. First, while the public sector, and in particular the destination marketing organization, aims to project the uniqueness, culture and heritage of Dubai, the private sector is focusing on promoting modern tourism and business facilities. In many cases, we even suspect a denial of the existence of local people and a removal of the relationships between the guests and the local culture. Hence, the various players are working at cross purposes and should realize that public and private interests are more connected than they have appreciated thus far. The interrelationship of strategic challenges and place branding, particularly as far as the need to project consistent images is concerned, has become more important with the expansion of global media and the proliferation of ICT (Magala 2001). Convergence of the two will only accelerate this process.", "authors": [{"name": "Robert  Govers", "ids": ["40510481"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Frank M.

Data for the analysis were collected from mainstream media, sport organisations websites and government archives. In addition, a two-round series of semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders was undertaken in the aftermath of the Cricket World Cup.\n\n\nFindings\nIn the case of Christchurch, the earthquakes and the destruction of much of the downtown provided a recovery opportunity, with the 2015 Cricket World Cup used to expedite the development of a new sporting venue in the city centre and rebrand the city to international tourists and sport enthusiasts.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe Hagley Park cricket oval case study provides evidence on the rhetoric of urban competitiveness and the use of hallmark sporting events to reframe urban development in post-disaster contexts.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis research provides further evidence on the logics of disaster capitalism and how cities embark on costly redevelopment projects for sports and events whilst overlooking exacerbating vulnerabilities among the local community.\n", "authors": [{"name": "C.

While cooperation conditions the existence of the organization as a system, conflict ensures the dynamics of the system, but it can also be a source of progress. Conflict management within an organization is a current issue, primarily in the practical activity, but also on a theoretical level, with a view to finding solutions. Research has shown that managers spend between 20 and 50 % of their time trying to handle conflicts within the organization. In an organization there are people and groups that compete for influence and resources, there are differences of opinion, different interests and values, there are conflicts of priorities and goals. Thus, the concern is in what way does the conflict have positive effects and if the competition that it generates is a favourable element or not. The acceptance from the part of the manager of the reality according to which conflict is an inevitable presence in any organization represents an essential premise for its settlement, even for its transformation in a potential source for the development of the business.", "authors": [{"name": "Elisabeta Andreea Budacia", "ids": ["112871979"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["f578fcdca06d09a3cecd11dda0d092fc8b5bc328"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2016, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e79dc391ebe8620dad006e07e9c4ca62fa6a1ff4", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "Romanian Economic and Business Review", "journalVolume": "11", "journalPages": "25-29", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2747394728", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

The research approach was quantitative. The research method was a survey with the data collected through a structured online questionnaire which was sent to all (1504) the SMEs operating in the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 area. The response rate was 7 %. The questionnaire was adopted from a formerly developed instrument for measuring the adoption of a new innovation. The purpose of the questionnaire was to gather anonymous information about perceptions towards implementing a brand strategy. The theory part discusses the concepts such as branding, brand strategy and strategy management literature followed by the Diffusion of Innovations theory by E. Rogers introducing a study of adopting a new innovation and its attributes affecting the adoption process. The results were presented as tables and figures showing the percentages of all citations. The results indicate the current perceptions, challenges and future plans that the SME managers have to face when supervising their company toward implementing a brand strategy. The results indicate that the rate of commitment to implementing a brand strategy was not high. A brand strategy was not perceived as mandatory to implementing although they perceived a company to have a relative advantage and better visibility resulting from implementing a brand strategy. There were varied conceptions of the demonstrability and practical implementation of the results. The conclusions indicate that although the relative advantages are visible to the majority, there are still things that hold managers back when it comes to implementing a brand strategy in their company. It seems that the commitment level is low because the stakeholders do not require that.", "authors": [{"name": "Satu  Korhonen", "ids": ["70242328"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["113c447cd7ef2544f24f77342ee5d0bbcc44825c", "3299830dcdaaca31beba5b654c0efcd0cde25099", "b6e01cf3d72177ec31a36c09d2f08dfd5ae79fd4", "23b4b5a709c477beb232f10ebd99d5dcc065070c", "ed6d9295d9fedb35701ee548deeb13edd29b8829", "bef028d7d7fcb4705c24451304b089f4912920d4", "0a71c731bba8dcf02e277c0a9ee0ddef7cdc6fa1", "d045b484222beef09895a0700830f76124a4d787", "7c735b28a2b38896ddbbb9a99f9ce9764b15d473", "05405f091eebde6d4b34d54f36090b5222a91bee", "7bb39a95002d6179bb86c8c9a222a9af03d7d0f2", "56e75d29e15b197e17be855f7b81d1328533bb10", "743daecd798a376578f5b2711300198ca44c8631"], "year": 2014, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1b863b05aaaa6dd6d28ed0aecb9841281b19e191", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/79104/Satu_Korhonen_BachelorsThesis.pdf;jsessionid=E2106F70DED771D7DD1CBBA58F6F89F0?sequence=1"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "1808532813", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Micro Evidence for Latin America", "paperAbstract": "Using a unique dataset with information on the currency composition of firms' assets and liabilities in six Latin-American countries, I investigate how the choice of exchange rate regime affects firms' foreign currency borrowing decisions and the associated currency mismatches in their balance sheets. I find that after countries switch from pegged to floating exchange rate regimes, firms reduce their levels of foreign currency exposures, in two ways. First, they reduce the share of debt contracted in foreign currency. Second, firms match more systematically their foreign currency liabilities with assets denominated in foreign currency and export revenues--effectively reducing their vulnerability to exchange rate shocks. More broadly, the study provides novel evidence on the impact of exchange rate regimes on the level of un-hedged foreign currency debt in the corporate sector and thus on aggregate financial stability.", "authors": [{"name": "Herman  Kamil", "ids": ["66720483"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["d1e89a948cdea9e92ced49edfe8d67a95bfa2e2a", "8d96eabf7dfa95e5d389d0bd180ab28658b4ab31", "34058a00893d6d12598ac2809488a5bb6ed977b7", "cc17df6d78fa9e70d6b01d756a5a23692117835f", "0de7ca902f3e99ece98b5c3fb5b5cd8bf170bf82", "d8d58c997ecb9b839da851f1864c9289be7916aa", "767c44ce7a89739071cb6cc92ed495626b5f2bc3", "be0092814e9e8337fb9c685aa6e3dee812eacfec", "2c38dd5a723540e39ee5c8e48c77c4c07ba9c8a0", "7e29d4ca322f226c9a7985fb9fab82b86eb266cd", "33a89c005c334c14291dacab3b55a71f89103a95", "7eb414cc196a331ca86f62f70ece4ebf8d7c6eac", "4f63a46be7fa888b90e6bf2f53667c1ba7cb70d9", "b6de4523829c22156c4697d0bf7ae3c5baf6b05a", "4babb1077c23f870b16771535a624bd64d75ccd6", "384b18248048d1c448f097a35c85b5b4cf1b51c0", "fc9dc38402db89130d078618c5a1235b429b12f4", "79f588262cf0d194f0a71e37ce1d728f2eecb68f", "36d547e94c7706e6dc7f1f63281f890c0f692828", "d6ce6f38975f3f43f49aefdd4a27219e5d7595ab", "755e07085bed2f8d4d04601f0ef72262a9ed9e2b", "e28a5b384266d156f105d884a26f37bf93e1e815", "bfcbbc03df909636828273c4684b0b7bda38f99f", "eb7f669b7d0a91b50fc87786712c1266205ec9cc", "e4d168aef7830344ef1d444ad0d33d990f7dfdfe", "463d61c98c4ac9002167efb4ab39a922473a1985", "e88d0a67b797e4b28b2f9102a4857d2241a98b30", "36eb0614c334cb4b5dc7bb0e130c2b29bfccef54"], "outCitations": ["ea697e0bc617f3475a4e85a0c8a862cbf07e201c", "bb37c7a65181e7df6e8ed2151d60edf2e9384d7f", "217b4ba35d6910f736b826b4b6b8137e6a27de20", "780ddd4bf916b4d64aaa335194061211c6b7e068", "decccc61df302fe8820e7f51175d6d4ea7d8ea51", "f6d4d771d35addc8b3d1acb96f52850e79bf89e1", "b3f8e96b82f8568ebaa0786d7acf8aa9e3cd11cc", "9bd38956c7430b1df34afadb54a376e181572d6f", "fca32c12471e6543f1b9b0e1949ca0c220450e8d", "f45cbdc15e0979c1b3f834b684d60c819970cb68", "7a0b85fe824d4074c6986bdef752d5464421b801", "4a3b13cb1913b6326fe0a514c19911438bba1f1e", "952cf44957dc84d221080f93d2231d62cd417365", "81a04cb2df8a6308085cf27ca705c66511cf000f"], "year": 2012, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/41e57b8309e3a14c2ea27eebeee9d27dc452701d", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "12", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.5089/9781463939052.001.A001", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.5089/9781463939052.001.A001", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "1969087021", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

The model as a whole was not able to significantly predict bank performance, F(2,11,) = .361, p = .708, R = .083. There was no relationship between corporate governance structure, employees\u2019 perception of leadership style of bank leaders, and performance of banks. When corporate governance is practiced in organizations, it strengthens the structure of the banks. Implementation of corporate governance mechanisms serves as an internal control mechanism and reduces agency conflicts by aligning the interests of management with the interests of owners.The results of this study could be of interest to bank leaders who need to understand the relationship between corporate governance structure, employees\u2019 perception of leadership styles, and bank performance. In some previous studies, corporate governance structure and perception of leadership style were found to impact positively on bank performance. A qualitative study to ascertain why the relationship studied is not significant in correlation could be most useful as a benefit to stakeholder\u2019s understanding. Nigerian Banking Governance, Leadership Style, and Performance During the 2008-2009 Financial Crisis by Adeola Agbato MBA, University of Wales, 1998 BS, University of Lagos, 1993 Doctoral Study Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Business Administration Walden University November 2016 Dedication I dedicate this doctoral study to the glory of the Almighty God. I received the inspiration for this program while I was completing my first degree. Alhough I started this program 20 years after ending my first degree, completing this program despite very personal challenges, is a testimony to the faithfulness of the Almighty God. Acknowledgments I wish to acknowledge the support of my family, my colleagues at FITC, my course mates, and the entire faculty at Walden University for making this dream a reality. God bless you all. I would like to gratefully acknowledge my parents, Enoch and Florence Ogunfiade, for sowing the seeds of lifelong learning in my early childhood and nurturing this seed until my adulthood. They inspired me to pursue learning and sharing what I have learnt with others. I would also like to acknowledge my husband, Gbenga, for his unflinching support. My children, Olaoluwa and Ayooluwa, encouraged me by always asking this question \u201cSo, Mummy, when are you going to America for your graduation?\u201d, wanting to accompany me for the ceremony). I certainly could not abandon the program half way, due to this reason, despite the numerous challenges. My appreciation also goes to my colleagues at FITC, my cohorts in the 9000 classes, and entire faculty. In particular, Dr. Alice Grabielle shared her personal story in Residency 1, which I will never forget; that story kept me moving during the program. Dr. Freda Turner also provided a shoulder to lean on during critical moments in the journey. Last but definitely not the least, my appreciation goes to my chair, Dr. Kevin Davies. Dr. d. (as he prefers to be called in class) provided an atmosphere of learning during the doctoral study. He always motivated the 9000 cohorts with the words \u201ckeep pressing\u201d and certainly we did press on. I could not have gotten a better chair than Dr. d.", "authors": [{"name": "Adeola Oluwayemi Agbato", "ids": ["122586320"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations":

It is an integrated crop management system that attempts to match the kind & amount of inputs with the actual crop needs for small areas within a farm fields. This study is basically based on the secondary data and it is a review paper. As it is a review paper so, there was less opportunity to follow any specific method in preparing this paper. Valuable information has been collected through internet browsing, journals etc. In this paper, we examine that, GPS, GIS, VRT, profitability, yield mapping etc. are most common precision agriculture techniques where, GIS can help in site-specific applications of fertilizers and soil amendments and help effectively detect and map black fly infestations, making it possible to achieve precision in pest control. Remote sensing combined with GIS and GPS can help in site-specific weed management. From the review we observed that, the global adoption of yield monitors has been predominated in North-America and Europe. The precision technologies have been used on a wider variety of crops in Denmark and UK than in the US. In Bangladesh, precision agriculture has great prospect as our country is highly natural calamity sensitive and through it we can easily take measure to prevent our agricultural products from damage caused by natural calamities. Though, precision agriculture is very costly but the benefit from it is more than its cost for most of the developing countries. So, the precision agriculture has great prospect in Bangladesh as well as in the world and it is the utmost time to adopt this technology in our traditional agriculture. Res. Agric., Livest.

After reviewing the institutional perspective and other previous contributions to the characterisation of HRM practices in call centres, the authors present evidence of the use of high commitment working practices (HCWP) in this sector. The findings report only a moderate presence of HCWP in the sector generally, but the analysis points towards the existence of four significant and distinct clusters of HRM practices. The results also show categorical evidence that work discretion is almost non-existent across all of the clusters, even in those with more evolved high commitment practices. This lack of autonomy, as well as an intensive use of performance monitoring systems, leads us to model the results in a bird\u2013cage analogy.", "authors": [{"name": "Neus  Mart\u00ed-Aud\u00ed", "ids": ["1472273605"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Mireia  Valverde", "ids": ["2795936"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Noreen  Heraty", "ids": ["98364746"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["943b77d915fcf119c076655f6d8cd47d82a77c65", "def882d941e0854b7677ee245bd4cc8d411b2f58", "2a545de6ec5aeb1cc191c17ed461236f851c85fb", "89545f018444d0d3119b595c317647866321ada2", "bca38b26fee4202b1feb7bdb5b5e1e24d0d79a78", "20340d18a5eba95700755d19ed0db168ece4d9a2", "770dd49508c3fc924357f11b3397ac97183d0520", "5d02037f0f862c80a1ceaadb73996554fc449976", "236a63a1460da4e56e7e2df8703245ca9cbb9a19", "d3b6a1e946712a577bc834b98fb11fd744e39733", "c73d4807344abf88323546cefee8beaf4d61e5cb", "a782fec20239dda1596a35d2a01f624ea8f82263", "9f862eb8d82732a2feadbb01576e79d93d7597d6"], "outCitations": ["287e836dfdea678e5fac99bf15b368b6f6d9d10d", "40897efb5d69eeae967c73014e1c765e61088383", "16241e1844bd9ffdb6f82b9f85133302838ecfb8", "5bc7680a31270ba65958a7527d37b3f9dbcc0024", "37973fbbb52758a4ef0ef25cd2af3da9efd891f1", "2783adf34c8a090375f8266faaf31b0c38d93049", "d82c3003c882013dbdfbfda4915732425b3d59ce", "ae1db01e5262d5269f0f4f08aa11e13eca5496db", "db61ae0982769824edc9510c679461934075de0e", "10348edc2d2d7ee714a65c330dacfed881ba2385", "80baee27bf4f6eecc8b1ccc8d1276b4ed0d83c17", "cb23f486ccee051f3d1f62d84f53a9c282831426", "b289b7fc1a5fa40e8d3337c31a892453aa570fa2", "0f47713a2b401809ed015745d1db720050ec1dea", "c206678550463b3f4790990f61a804a246228433", "d5446b8885851f677862851b88fb74dadc9708f3", "5a2dd205c605515d2b9bf896cd93f55a618236f1", "a87a60d3633815699e26c0f8098152a53a7f7c40", "6f681b9e49e1a2022bbee665aa7b3c1a1392ff78", "e7add51a0cd830eba3ae6d920649508a7c4a3fc2", "c8d831a81dbb430ca8adf064545fca070bb7ca12", "6d62126bf9cbd03a52abc4905aa0bcfe8914014f", "3e5d01dd9d86d2e0469ae966879248b67e237fb5", "e664904d67915ac742578c90b3762ad664b167e5", "3fe719303ea1d414d01edcc90cf774ab4c6aa079", "0af291910cf97d2cb5dc5d2bdfe483fd634785e1", "32e034131e09f0c733d410d646e4ff03cac96a20", "4249ccc273f6f4a74077a64b2045a654faf05a6e", "da311554d3d1135f10c2add573970b6cbb4999ce", "ef4ca45c26d1f9b314c6aa115eaf15400fcfc465", "ee536e9d58aee82db483b4cea001882f6a16805a", "03470997e951f33410e645b8fb682f12fd4cb231", "31985bec42309675409959595b2fc316c1e0c4d7", "c4be81f4c5500044ba2a3a4ce4cd9e95dc6650f5", "16c0796903ddff65ae73dfe20788413cd0e212b8", "4bfe71b1969b4c32cbb1320c6296e740d1862e28", "9098bd0c994851d77eb9675c5e990ff414b2724a", "a820dc3c42458a839b834d6eed2f68e6a5eb8071", "e8a52f69c176e07e8e2673f0054d615330979e6b", "36acc62223dcad49032147d650a8e7a819d888a5", "dcc8fdfb18c269b7174d6d1a489a080f2b3a8dbf"], "year": 2013, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/756a910cee14ca110ce8dd705c565b936c8f4c55", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "The International Journal of Human Resource Management", "journalVolume": "24", "journalPages": "308 - 329", "doi": "10.1080/09585192.2012.677463", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09585192.2012.677463", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2073818306", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Telecommunications Companies (Telcos) are profiting from these service offerings as the demand for broadband network access can be derived as a complementary product. However, OTTs are also offering communication Apps like VoIP or messaging services that are substituting traditional Telco services (e.g. telephony and SMS). Telcos are facing the erosion of traditional retail market revenues as OTTs are more agile and innovative and better use price models like advertising and data selling rather than rental and usage fees. Net-neutrality rules are limiting the discretionary freedom of Telcos for attack and co-operation strategies. Thus Telcos need to concentrate on their strength of network ownership. One element is pricing attractive bundles of network access and data usage, often in combination with Telco/OTT retail service bundles. The other element will be the slicing of their network for specific \u201cvertical\u201d industry use cases (e.g. in the IoT M2M, eHealth, autonomous driving segment). Network slicing with specific features that the public internet does not guarantee like low latency, high security or guaranteed high data throughput cannot be copied by OTTs.", "authors": [{"name": "Arnulf  Heuermann", "ids": ["122415189"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["d7ae2383346cdc516f20ff052a01528a204d522c", "d7fe06caf0451817dee8411f0d3fe7001f2d9c1c"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2018, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5ab9efe20e03771adc07837d380a786fdc841178", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "Management for Professionals", "journalName": "Management for Professionals", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-77724-5_22", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-77724-5_22", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2883639024", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

{"id": "c7c31de45ac3a0a5a5ec001622801a285db265ba", "title": "Directing store flyers to the appropriate audience", "paperAbstract": "Grocery shoppers were questioned about the frequency of purchasing items that were featured in the store's flyers. This measure was used as the dependent variable in a multinomial logit model with the independent variables being various aspects of shopping behaviour, usage of store flyers, age and employment status. Since only one threshold parameter was significant, the four-level dependent variable was then collapsed and a binary model was estimated. This study evidenced that less than half of the respondents looked forward to receiving unsolicited flyers. Most shoppers read the flyers only to be informed of price specials that the store has to offer. The odds ratio of responding to store flyer deals among those who look forward to sales flyers is more than double the odds ratio of those who do not await the flyers, across every category of shopping frequency. Retailers could employ direct marketing to target specific audiences who look forward to receiving store flyers.", "authors": [{"name": "Mario J.

Using the process of commercialization of intangible assets, an enterprise receives both income and competitive advantage. The enterprise increases its market value as a participant of the intellectual property market since industrial intellectual property brings economic benefits, which increase together with its production volume. The present research featured a set of problematic aspects that level the effectiveness of the commercialization of new technologies at Russian enterprises. The research objective was to identify the main difficulties that enterprises face in the process of commercial implementation of industrial intellectual property. The author analyzed indicators that reflect the current practice of commercializing innovations in Russia. The article also focuses on the relationships between the entities participating in the commercialization process and the ways of their effective legal regulation.

We selected samples from the Automotive Component and Allied Manufacturers in South Africa. Initially, we sent the structured questionnaire online using Google forms to 800 potential respondents. After doing follow ups, we received 230 completed survey responses. Further, data preparation is done using established scientific approach and we checked suitability of its use in structural equation modelling. After ensuring all necessary checks are completed, the results are found satisfactory to further proceed with testing of research hypotheses.,It is observed that technological capabilities, organizational capabilities and environmental capabilities show significant effect on Logistics 4.0 capabilities. However, the outcome of technological capabilities and environmental capabilities on Logistics 4.0 capabilities (s\u00a0=\u00a00.27) is found stronger than organizational capabilities. Logistics 4.0 capabilities shows significant effect on firm performance.,It is important that the sustainability goals are aligned with Logistics 4.0 strategies. Managers need to increase focus towards development of Logistics 4.0 dynamic capabilities that enhance agility and responsiveness in the supply chain.

Existing research assumes that such restrictions are accepted as a quid pro quo for resolving the problem of double taxation, which might act as an obstacle to inward investment. This paper uses archival documents to examine treaty negotiations between the United Kingdom (UK) and developing countries during the 1970s, focusing on contentious provisions concerning \u2018tax sparing\u2019, the taxation of shipping, and withholding taxes. Consistent with critical literature on tax treaties, it finds that neither side was concerned about the double taxation problem, which was resolved unilaterally by the UK\u2019s tax credit. Rather, developing countries were primarily focused on obtaining matching tax credits in the UK to maximise the benefits to investors from their tax incentives. UK priorities, meanwhile, were to bind developing countries into OECD-type tax treatment of British firms. Negotiated outcomes did not reflect the true balance of costs and benefits to each side, but their different negotiating capacities, the political salience of particular taxes, and the precedent certain concessions might set for future negotiations", "authors": [{"name": "Martin  Hearson", "ids": ["108689373"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["9bf45b70631e26d9b904188eaca2ee332d588ffb", "4a1426b0b90a00cfc89286539617928146f4bddd", "96ba1bf343df1bf28b0ab319cc86fb9853d9b02e", "962bab1e3888e58e3db6bfcc1841787e729b008b", "4a27c16712d9eba8739a786cc8880ef1c11d4c1d", "fd5aa3ea76503c90a8a7d2498fb1f4d7f4dbdd3f"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2017, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/305782365a5f2567f3006661138971044150872f", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://martinhearson.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/the-uks-tax-treaties-with-developing-countries-accepted-version.pdf", "http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/74104/1/Hearson_UK's%20tax%20treaties%20with.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Development Economics: Macroeconomic Issues in Developing Economies eJournal", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.5040/9781509908400.ch-013", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.5040/9781509908400.ch-013", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2613136169", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has classified the biological agents into three categories based on the potential of use and risk factors as weapons. The biological agent should have the following characteristics in order to be effective for use in biological warfare: highly virulent, highly contagious, short incubation period, easy production, easy dispersion, easy handling, and susceptibility to target population. Usually found in nature, these agents are chemically changed to amplify their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. These agents can be spread through the food, water or air. Since these biological agents are extremely difficult to detect, terrorists may use it. In this brief review we have reiterated the overview of bioterrorism and its agents.", "authors": [{"name": "Menezes  Ga", "ids": ["78990341"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["e7d79259a9e866ad69a854a088e9163594455a41", "2ce5fa9f523b99827731d0dd398b4a0c2d3a35c5", "1389936f34e229fc9fe713d40a52f5ed35db0fcd", "2036bb1a2e95e25e9dc8891d4e494bd051ad5547", "e1f38e0ad95348c6978827eb0217f4c27a2d63be", "fafed6576617c0d04570fece6a6fd26b363e9498", "9959e593e42e06164a7482fa459d84bf66239561", "f8d014a64f5d73fe4fcb310d9cac6e561760d441", "ca17b9ce185c355bba66020d87801de05420a393", "5bee094c493991fa58a80a582eee8124e8542b9c", "a7581b8ed75d7b9b3b2534b7e949553c9e103b01", "4972c2d28f13494a4ba069e5cd90e3405fd56811"], "year": 2013, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fe3a3d5ae915d4791432081e7a08a15375e992aa", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.ijpbs.net/cms/php/upload/2583_pdf.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "International journal of pharma and bio sciences", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2186067212", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Single-industry towns are the \u201cweak spot\u201d of Russia. In such municipalities, the dependence of the settlement on the city-forming enterprise is clearly expressed, which causes well-founded concerns in the conditions of the economic crisis in which the Russian Federation has been staying for a long time. The population of single-industry towns may be left without jobs and wages, the city budget will lose the monetary component of the taxes of the city-forming enterprise. In such situation population outflows may begin, the city will lose its social attractiveness and may eventually cease to exist as a municipality. The comprehensive investment plan is the main instrument of state financial support for the integrated development of single-industry towns, which is aimed at eliminating the dependence of a single-industry entity on the city-forming enterprise, improving the socio-economic condition of the city, improving and finding the investment attractiveness of the municipality. The article deals with the problems of the spatial development of the territory of the single-industry city of Tolyatti, taking into account the socio-economic orientation. A search is being made for a solution to the town-planning use of the city\u2019s territory on the basis of a comprehensive investment modernization plan.

Utilizing SOX as an exogenous shock on firm risk, we find that proxy fight threats are positively related to a firm\u2019s total risk and idiosyncratic risk. Specifically, although firm risk generally decreases post-SOX, high proxy fight threats mitigate this change in firm risk. We also find that although firms adopt more conservative policies such as decreasing their leverage and payout post-SOX, these changes are mitigated by proxy fight threats. In sum, our findings indicate that proxy fights act as an external disciplinary mechanism, encourage executive risk-taking, and increase firm risk.", "authors": [{"name": "Fang  Chen", "ids": ["2149500853"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Jian  Huang", "ids": ["47513413"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Han  Yu", "ids": ["2110983467"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["b35df69091c0164a233485545e101c6eaeecb6a6", "ec8c9b7bee4ca30e7e3ea63fea6efae8b66f74b8", "c87f0516de89c27977c4662d4072f3cd9967fb5e", "a4707e0000e4fc15dc2d43218a252994993c9341", "bb0ced180a81f96c160a75ecb5eb5743205bd9ba", "eae16de184f57e5769ffc58121c8a950b47d4a3d", "3a3c5c812a2d3845f829ce389be530303b50b4b9", "a1b18ed4b4fb7d091ad5843d5460bc2d1fab2a2a", "70183fe2bab484cd26d2a9146345f871bdd29115", "556e815e4594198f7f43b2e6f00509b08281cf53", "5b0b85c1ddfc377636e76f85aa515016ea6ec93f", "121c86bbbebc07ac9a5983145da28c49c3180164", "d75076b9f7948238b5a1d2bf6682c4a2da76d6cc", "3d2f3583be256d58fdcac20df2b0f469e4c0e1c4", "4c23166d8fa93fdbd1d4f8e7f8893d0b78024a6e", "6264ba5de0e9342f1f7f22bb94e40e8504810a85", "a791e2f7cc649017b88e37b74e85fa4a7f18db87", "21c9701ceea524b45c24498e0418ffaa13ca5a72", "749c36c1f31b3f299530dc6316195b4bfdfff1f7", "0bde8062d9594a10681bacb94862a793b06eabfb", "c9d4fde8bf5e639684b584010b73643f8a566bb1", "bd770112f04709dc5cebb24aaf3cf07616640f1b", "ae48c66d5e86722277c507f00f61256836b0ecee", "aefc384b7cbe69dc1c5fd765abf6f0073afde7c3", "ce3b37a8824e3a1021f75400a351499268741a8c", "a59b646bdaca6a468ff57b47dd638294b90e256a", "fa32ac55fdf38a29f702fdb6a754717c50d3fe63", "dbbc3224a673970ef411d32977f30cbc3dba8bd8", "8a23f4a4d5aa6cb0b8b7a4df7f593acde91f2193", "45fecc728886ef24b8a85d3268e4fd357110d797", "a66e43aad4ae5e29082a4a78a4c10ce55896f9db", "0d8e6fa1c179a1ca077f3d4ec75c68c4754f7352", "000a3d805b0cefea08112101e04baafcb51f3d83", "c27c4cb16500905c0120de7c0b4d1c0ec5c453a0", "8157083a09271bc8322d0230b81cfeecedcdcc77", "ee6070bd7a3742956100722a3623f8ca9a04fdae", "5bae7f7d6f47bb6eed317ccb8db6af5c6b4ac17a", "abee6d59222d4096e878640f58c137a09da839df", "f02b1111b71a8ea847498e7be4bbb38c5d2893a3", "ca2c9db3bb84569ccb47d9e472f96f16019b2037", "e065cb385ab23e7f613f57c1017a09f3dd94d65a", "4a016c7b58b443044d3ae7ea5ee045ebb585dd5d", "3efce7b70513ae465a716bbf9edf951ac60497de", "b41db4c2bba7744309e817ea2151f40b44e0f22f", "6762acdba7dea361a9e2b8b7aa63104a97302631", "7209ca949f5eaf1d888f8633ae177cfa54550cb9", "02a8b47a7a078b121c91aabab002181007206887", "08b6d197f9554c220db4e362ef0ac5463c8bd8c5"], "year": 2018, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6e2e5969c789ca49604e19fd86f22531fcd59b3e", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "Accounting and Finance Research", "journalVolume": "7", "journalPages": "96", "doi": "10.5430/AFR.V7N2P96", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.5430/AFR.V7N2P96", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2785328540", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

New marketing strategies and ways to identify and communicate with prospects and existing customers had to be found. In Finland, during the latter part of the last century, many small IT and digital services companies appeared, and therefore this thesis seeks to describe the degree to which these two types of companies are co-operating with each other within the music industry. The research began by investigating existing digital marketing tools available for music industry. Next, a qualitative research approach was employed to explore insights provided by eight notable professionals in the Finnish music industry and digital service companies. The combination of secondary and primary data enabled to discover in both broad and deep contexts the digital marketing tools and strategies now available and the level of collaboration within the researched companies. In addition, the thesis focuses on explicating the use of web 2.0 applications by Finnish music and digital service companies. The results show that digital marketing tools are embraced by majority of the companies studied. Collaboration between the two fields has encountered multiple obstacles although there is a lot of potential for broader business relationship. The existing digital marketing tools and the level of collaboration present inability to define how these can be used profitably in such a way that also does not negatively affect the attitudes and purchasing behaviours of customers.", "authors": [{"name": "Laura  Immonen", "ids": ["120417317"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Jaakko  Joensuu", "ids": ["2074133857"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["c0e2663d66f875244a8dea344d97ae3819d92549"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3175467e1bf04333a600986ec76cf8a74bb0df80", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/6666/Laura_Immonen%20Jaakko_Joensuu%20Thesis.pdf;jsessionid=F7C77A0A1818FB3A286E4BBFA2B81212?sequence=1"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2283335868", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Various study showed that satisfaction plays an important role to establish loyal customer base. This study points out that satisfaction and loyalty relationship is critical for retail banks. Understanding the factors behind loyalty as well as the antecedents of customer satisfaction is an important issue for academic research as well as for marketing in financial services. The major aim of this study is to identify satisfaction as the major factor behind customer loyalty in retail banking. To comply with the aim, two basic questions has been investigated where one is related to determine the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty in retail banking, and the second one is to determine the role of dimensions of service quality towards satisfaction. The research has been carried out through secondary research and primary research. Survey method has been used for primary research. Personal contact approach through questionnaire has been introduced to conduct the survey. The findings reveal that satisfaction and loyalty are related to each other. Moreover, satisfaction has a positive and direct impact on loyalty in banking.", "authors": [{"name": "Mohammad  Shamsuddoha", "ids": ["104666236"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Mohammed  Alamgir", "ids": ["1804585"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["e2fb6341f8389ec0fa95f741967520f2c939aada", "d6e4b9575d11b9eeda98a6c60d2c252ca32d9fdc", "a4329ecefcee28a1d10c4fda5bc86627c89ebfd7", "6321e233d9f3b11ecb629ff4860d9b5a520f5b67", "9d397e87675630c17c93d9e36fc056d4177b2263", "cac96b8ce2929782de4ac2f3eb097e1fb283af7a", "34b303e4eb3aa2f667168c282e3b9a1726c7f01f", "9bf9fe9924be193e377787c8c61d43c3a1069126", "5b299411841e75ba52197a8b5fcf73a773c1906b", "518613bd688af0f664e9e479b27aef45a273b5a3", "9f10d21b7161ad59d941e5deb095fc85499e3427"], "outCitations": ["8e1d9898e4805c2d4e729ca7ace58ecf9cf7f9eb", "c954916712c2c28c4bee9c49ef4fe1030d330f13", "e2489af20d3dd2318872592e1d84bac209bbc48a", "618343bee669d361102b3f68ad3e586d308a2ed2", "bf4476d66c70151936dc9030b5868d144bea03c2", "66e04508579b6594ea6eee24367a45dba892ec7d", "c19e2dc21223c0219685b4a9c3b7b63071c8b872", "d1a71d10f56d45b731c5be02a14dbe8e3f07c2d0", "35de7ec7562c85314bba99068e00bd02f14e39df", "43ab9dd7aa318b8cdd6790b95667e8dc930ed342", "59234dfc81e571232626e15cf2feecf72cc5c2a6", "3b157a4477cab25b1602f8e34cd7cf7645091fb3", "d26a2423f00ca372b424a029ae22521299f00ede", "be77652dba855d3f8475233b530b31fa906ff301", "74bea210887a87447fc50d8b2b6708eca25c80e8", "a35d0a3dbbbf6d2e57ad6d2731e13dc3f5700f14", "ef9b0eb07c1ad365956334342b6722bb6bb15756", "570b3cd536d91762a886f9ab648a78d8061870e9", "346d472503ec21317fb62e778ca415f9fae1dbb0"], "year": 2003, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0a3522b60f2aeef2db102a4af66062c643fd8b4f", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "Microeconomic Theory eJournal", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2171639980", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

We base our analysis on a sample of 597 US firms over the period 2005\u20132009. We find that both monetary and non-monetary incentives have an effect on CSR decisions. Specifically, monetary incentives designed to align the CEO\u2019s and shareholders\u2019 interests have a negative effect on CSR and non-monetary incentives have a positive effect on CSR. The study has important implications for the design of executive remuneration (compensation) plans, as we show that there are many levers that can affect the CEO\u2019s decisions with regard to CSR. Our evidence also confirms the prominent role of the CEO in relation to CSR decisions, while also recognizing the complexity of factors affecting CSR.

An information marketplace is different from other marketplaces because an information good is not actually consumed and can be reproduced and distributed at almost no cost. For information producers to remain profitable, they will need to minimize their exposure to competition. For example, information can be sold by charging site access rather than information access fees, or it can be bundled with other information or \u201cversioned.\u201d For information consumers, a variation of Malthus' law predicts that the exponential growth in information will mean that specific information will become increasingly expensive to find, because search costs will grow but human attention will remain limited. Furthemore, the low cost of creating poor-quality information on the Web means that the low-quality information may eventually swamp high-quality resources. The use of reputable information portals on the Web, or smart search technologies, may help in the short run, but it is unclear whether an \u201cinformation famine\u201d is avoidable in the longer term.", "authors": [{"name": "Enrico W.

This paper introduces the concepts and aims of sustainable agriculture in India. Sustainable agricultural development comprises sustainability of agricultural production and agricultural marketing, sustainability of the rural economy, ecological and environmental sustainability within agricultural systems and sustainability of rural society. India can safely be characterized as an agricultural country despite the recent spurt in manufacturing and services and the declining share of agriculture in the national income, since majority of its workforce (650%) is still engaged in agriculture and allied activities. It has been the noblest profession in India since the time immemorial and has been carried out on sustainable basis. It is only relatively recent phenomenon that large-scale forest areas, grazing lands and waste lands have been converted into croplands to support the rising population, which has caused ecological imbalance and atmospheric pollution. With no further scope for expansion of agricultural land efforts have been made to enhance the production of food grains using high-yielding variety of seeds, fertilizers and irrigation along with advanced farm equipments. Agriculture is the largest source of employment in India, and food accounts for about half of consumer expenditures. Moving agricultural products from the farm to consumers more efficiently could result in large gains to producers. consumers, and India \u2018s overall economy. More efficient agricultural marketing generates economy wide gains in output and wages, raises agricultural producer prices, reduces consumer food prices, and increases private consumption, particularly by low-income households. Sustainable agriculture, although a difficult term to define operationally, includes the practice of low input agricultural production technologies. An important condition to adopt these technologies is the access to markets for low input agricultural products. Ability to market these products at profitable prices would provide incentives for farmers to adopt the necessary methods. Contract farming is considered to be an effective means to introduce new production technologies to the farmers by providing assurance on prices and markets for agricultural products. Public extension agencies in developing countries may therefore be concerned to direct their efforts to introduce contract farming models to rural areas, and to encourage private firms to disseminate information on the appropriate production methods. The paper also emphasizes the importance and objectives of agricultural marketing. The conclusion is that to accelerate economic development of the economy, it is necessary to promote sustainability of agricultural marketing.", "authors": [{"name": "K. C.

The only existing corporate bond valuation model for creditrating-triggered products was formulated by Jarrow et al. However, this model does not incorporate the fact that increases in the coupon payment resulting from downgrades may cause a further deterioration of credit ratings and of the likelihood that the company will be able to make future coupon payments. In this paper, we present a credit-linked coupon bond valuation model that considers this issue. Using a structural approach, we extend the classical model of Merton by introducing a threshold value corresponding to each credit rating, and a volatility of the company value process that depends on its credit rating. Given these extensions, our model is more flexible than the JLT model, and we are clearly able to capture the above effect via numerical simulations. Furthermore, from the perspective of practical implications, the JLT model tends to value credit-linked coupon bonds more cheaply than does our model when the initial credit rating is high, while the reverse is true for a low initial credit rating.", "authors": [{"name": "K.

{"id": "8fafbddad82bd3584d45082434d204f90b5ed565", "title": "Value Management Integration for Whole Life Cycle: Post COVID-19 Strategy for the UK Construction Industry", "paperAbstract": "Value management (VM) and its integration in the whole life cycle (WLC) have become huge concepts for construction projects to provide additional value of an asset for the end user or client. However, the role of VM and its integration as part of the WLC in a construction project remain reactive, and highly impacted by nature of the project, and this has become more challenging with the epidemic impact of COVID-19. This research aims to investigate the mechanisms that delivers value management as part of the \u201cre-invent\u201d strategy proposed by the Construction Leadership Council in the UK government to improve WLC for buildings. In addition to existing secondary data from the literature, primary data were attained using a focus group with six quantity surveyors from different cost consultancies in the UK to gather qualitative evidence using their experiences, perceptions, and key challenges they face when integrating VM. Findings revealed that value management is primarily being used as a cost-cutting tool, the majority of quantity surveyors lack knowledge of what it encompasses, hence the industry needs a more proactive strategy towards it.

This dependence is compromising the environmental, social and economic health of cities in Canada. Furthermore, it appears as though automobile dependence is increasing in Canada, as are its attendant impacts. A fuller understanding of the primary relationships affecting this trend is needed if its impacts are to be adequately mitigated. However, there is little quantitative knowledge of the relative importance of factors contributing to automobile dependence in Canadian cities. A review of the literature identifies a multitude of mutually reinforcing factors that contribute to the creation of automobile dependent cities. The factors are both cause and effect and exhibit 'feedback,' which results in a cycle of intensification of the original condition. While there are many feedback relationships that contribute to automobile dependence, some may be stronger than others. Mitigating the many adverse impacts of automobile dependence requires reducing the need for both automobile ownership and automobile use by reversing these feedback relationships. This thesis identifies the relative importance of factors influencing automobile dependence in Canada's major cities through a comparative analysis of transportation, land use and population and employment distribution trends and patterns. This involves the collection and analysis of an extensive set of data from Canada's seven largest cities (Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa-Hull and Montreal). To provide context and supplementary information, selected data from thirty-four additional global cities are also used. A correlation analysis of the data collected identifies the strength of correlation between factors involved in automobile dependence feedback. The data reveal commonalities between cities: those cities with higher urban densities, higher transit service provision and lower automobile infrastructure provision exhibit lower levels of car ownership and use as well as higher levels of transit use. These cities also have better utilized transit systems, have higher walking and cycling mode shares and consume less fuel. The quantitative findings are used in tandem with the qualitative findings of the literature review to identify and rank eight possible points for policy intervention in changing auto dependence feedback. Of the factors examined, metropolitan and outer area density, transit supply and C B D parking supply appear to exert the strongest relative influence on auto dependence. These are followed in importance by inner area density and car ownership, which are followed by road supply and non-motorized transport share. While the auto dependence factors ranked require further study, clarification and confirmation, they provide a preliminary basis for directing policy analysis. A policy evaluation framework is developed that enables policies prescribed in each intervention area to be assessed against a series of travel, environmental, social and economic impact criteria as well as their implementation potential. This framework can be used by policymakers to identify high leverage policies for reducing auto dependence.", "authors": [{"name": "Tamim  Raad", "ids": ["122052561"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["ad6b413e117564ec5ea8d75d771965b2a3046572", "0a54d9306a1cf738bf11c650249789006ce43cd2", "94860b97ff58f592600e214e128ddda71fe8b667", "242da79c5808c68d80ef673132ab7f00dc56018b", "7dab6153781285a922291f8ee4a72d73b75d0c5a", "78ebe5259c7eb02131dba8cf537c63a625ca0667", "273bb34b286872f1315d0db891dbe2074b56b5b8", "9c30bd1e4d61ed915a4d3d02b4969f5c60377286", "7c5ee93a805a2646276c52f98ef932625574df73", "e95c355ff2fd52050ededb92833f9079c48d7200"], "outCitations": [], "year": 1998, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2a07b6c83ae35fa0bc31684753d15bac5329ade5", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/download/pdf/831/1.0088500/1", "https://christopherleo.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/car_in_canada.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.14288/1.0088500", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.14288/1.0088500", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2415432059", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Drawing from a large pooled sample of French and UK manufacturing firms, it investigates if firms can find a beneficial interplay between forms of innovation. A first analysis through a trivariate probit and a multinomial logit shows that the determinants of the different forms of innovation are not identical and the correlation of residuals in the trivariate probit displays national differences for the complementarities in use. The results of the tests of the complementarities in performance show that the efficient strategies of innovation combinations are not the same for all the firms. They depend on the national context as well as on the firm size and the firm capabilities, and give credit to the contingency hypothesis rather than to the naive view of a unique best strategy. The main combinations are the \"technological strategy\" (product-process innovations) and the \"structure oriented strategy\" (organization-product), and in no case the combination of the three strategies at the same time, which is presumably too costly or difficult.", "authors": [{"name": "G\u00e9rard  Ballot", "ids": ["101333735"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Fathi  Fakhfakh",

One of the main features of these developments has been their impact on the retail system, creating innovatory or, what Schumpeter termed, disruptive competition. Commenting on such processes in retailing, Schumpeter claimed that, 'the competition that matters arises not from additional shops of the same type (so called repetitive competition) but from the department stores, the chain store, the mail order house and the supermarket'. This was a theme taken up by other observers of retail change in early and mid-twentieth century North America. Thus, Bliss extended Schumpeter's ideas to include the shopping mall which he saw as an emerging innovating force in American retailing during the late 1950s. A similar theme was developed by Fulop in Britain who attempted to document this revolution in retailing during the 1950s and early 1960s. These retail institutions are of course very different in terms of when they evolved and in terms of their formats but they also share some important characteristics. These include their impact on other retailers (through disruptive competition) along with the way they transformed consumer culture. In addition, they all grew rapidly from their inception and have transferred into a range of economies. Within this context they have acquired a global reach through the processes of internationalisation and knowledge transfer. Of course there are differences in the development and spread of such innovations; for example, the department store had multiple centres of development almost simultaneously in Europe and North America. As a consequence there tended to be greater variations in the department store format across different cultures. By contrast the supermarket was very much a North American innovation that spread into Western Europe and then globally with some distinctive patterns of knowledge transfer, although in its diffusion there have been variations. The supermarket represents one of the pivotal retail innovations of the twentieth century that has had far reaching changes on shopping habits. It has also become a global retail format and been transformed into the larger scale superstore. It is significant that globally, the current largest retail organisations are all associated with superstore developments, centred around the", "authors": [{"name": "Gareth  Shaw", "ids": ["144655558"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["e4f6d82ddf679a9409e5a17eb039615b63b80886", "19a519fc9fc496b035a9a6683c4fd4ea4743bb7f", "7098e5f450ac8ee9d09ebcf5c65bd66ab1f44591", "03d519310c8814d82fe2343dea04545bde8d00f0", "ed06af482137d7f9a3581e6c7fe63e6866f16922"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2005, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/27929c7b2e0c6e2bfffb05cc4f3da0073de92df8", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "46", "journalPages": "57 - 70", "doi": "10.1524/jbwg.2005.46.2.57", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1524/jbwg.2005.46.2.57", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2242536064", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Incentive compensation in hospital medicine", "paperAbstract": "Objective: Though salary models vary, a portion of physician compensation is often provided as a bonus, or incentive payment,\u00a0based on clinical productivity measured by the relative value unit (RVU). However, many hospitalists are involved in activities\u00a0beyond clinical work, either administrative or educational, that may be difficult to measure and recognize in bonus payments.\u00a0Furthermore, the changing nature of physician and hospital reimbursement necessitates a focus on quality measures not\u00a0incentivized in the traditional RVU model. Methods: The authors describe a compensation model in an academic hospital medicine program that was initially developed\u00a0in 2010 and modified in 2013. The model incents clinical productivity and adherence to quality metrics while also promoting\u00a0nonclinical academic and administrative activities. Results: Implementation of this compensation model impacted the division\u2019s quality goals by increasing completion of discharge\u00a0summaries, reconciliation of discharge medications, and placement of follow-up appointment orders upon discharge. The impact\u00a0on clinical and academic productivity is less clear. Conclusions: A compensation model that accounts for academic productivity and quality goals along with clinical productivity\u00a0may be useful in incentivizing hospitalists in both academic and community-based hospital medicine practices. Future work\u00a0should focus on whether such a model can be used effectively to address additional targets such as reducing readmissions and\u00a0preventing hospital-acquired conditions.", "authors": [{"name": "A.

{"id": "146992405fe59511c7ad5bef15ae798c1dacde20", "title": "IMPLICATIONS OF CHEMICAL MIXTURES IN PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE", "paperAbstract": "The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) is a federal public health agency that investigates and strives to prevent human health problems produced by exposure to toxic chemicals and their mixtures in the environment. Most human exposures involving toxic chemicals or mixtures are thought to originate from environmental and occupational sources; however, concurrent exposures are also likely from other sources, such as prescription and nonprescription drugs, indoor air pollutants, alcohol, and tobacco smoke. Thus, in evaluating the potential hazard following exposure to environmental mixtures, ATSDR not only considers the inherent joint toxicity of the mixture but also the influence of environmental, demographic, occupational, and lifestyle factors. To foster these goals, ATSDR has pursued a Mixtures Research and Assessment Program that consists of three component efforts: trend analysis, joint toxicity assessment, and experimental testing. Through trend analysis, ATSDR sets priorities for environmental mixtures of concern for which joint toxicity assessments are conducted as needed. If data are not available to conduct appropriate assessments, a research agenda is pursued through established extramural mechanisms. Ultimately, the data generated are used to support ATSDR\u2019s work at sites involving exposure to chemical mixtures. This pragmatic approach allows testable hypotheses or research needs to be identified and resolved and enhances our understanding of the mechanisms of joint toxicity. Several collaborative and cooperative efforts with national and international organizations such as the Toxicology and Nutrition Office, the Netherlands, and the Department of Energy are being pursued as part of these activities. ATSDR also develops guidance manuals to consistently and accurately apply current methodologies for the joint toxicity assessment of chemicals. Further, expert panels often are assembled to resolve outstanding scientific issues or obtain expert advice on pertinent issues. Recently, the need for studies on chemical mixtures has been proposed as one of the six priority areas the agency identified in its agenda for public health environmental research. This has been reinforced through the agency\u2019s close work with communities whose leaders have spoken passionately about their concern for information on exposures to chemical mixtures. The five other priority research areas the agency identified are exposure, susceptible populations, communities and tribal involvement, evaluation/surveillance of health effects, and health promotion/prevention.", "authors": [{"name": "C T de Rosa", "ids": ["88453413"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "H A El-Masri", "ids": ["1398628880"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "H  Pohl",

At the same time, the \u2018traditional\u2019 Italian planning system is evolving, introducing new concepts, competences, tools and practices at the regional level. A reorganization of the environmental normative framework takes place as well, with direct consequences for existing environmental assessment procedures. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art of SEA in Italy. Opportunities and barriers for an effective implementation of the SEA Directive in this country are highlighted. It is concluded that the successful implementation of SEA in Italy will largely depend on a changing political context.

The right engagement approach may require knowledge of agents\u2019 preferences across multi-echelon supply chains to align private sector value creation with humanitarian outcomes. We propose a multi-attribute value analysis (MAVA) framework to elucidate such preferences. We formalize this approach and apply it in collaboration with a HO pilot aiming to facilitate better private sector availability of malaria rapid diagnostic tests in Uganda. We demonstrate how HOs could use criteria weights and value functions from MAVA for project evaluation; in the process, we reveal business model insights for importers, distributors, and retailers in the pilot. We also show how MAVA facilitates the impact assessment of hypothetical options (i.e., combinations of products, services, and subsidies) to guide HO resource deployment. This paper offers the first attempt, to our knowledge, to develop quantitative measures for economic and non-economic objectives involving all agents in a multi-echelon supply chain, either humanitarian or commercial. We hope that this initial step stimulates further research to validate results and develop the framework proposed.", "authors": [{"name": "Corinne  Carland", "ids": ["2247736"], "structuredName":

A \ncritical review of the works of Dupuis and Prime (1996) reveals erratic sales performance of \nhypermarkets operating in Taiwan and in other Asia-Pacific countries since 1989; this sales \ntrend may be linked to lack of understanding of Taiwanese shopping preferences and choices \n(Burt and Carralero-Encinas, 2000). This led to the research question: \u201cCan global food \nretailers using hypermarket store formats achieve and sustain their competitive advantage in \nemerging economies such as Taiwan\u201d. This led to statement of research objectives with the \noverall aim to investigate how global food retailers using a hypermarket store format can \nsuccessfully operate in the Taiwanese food retail market. These objectives were achieved by \nadopting a phenomenological research philosophy and a mix of focus group interviews and \nquestionnaires (Churchill and Iacobucci, 2005; Saunders et al., 2007). The primary data were \npresented and analysed using both qualitative and quantitative techniques through employed \nMicrosoft Excel and SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). \nThe thesis identified six critical factors: (1) facility convenience, (2) shopping environment, (3) \nconvenient products, (4) price incentive, (5) convenient services, and (6) shopping \nconvenience which impact Taiwanese store patronage. The results of the factor and cluster \nanalyses reveal that \u2018facility convenience\u2019 (with the highest alpha coefficient value of \u03b1 = \n0.748) has the greatest impact on five Taiwanese shopping clusters: (1) Value shoppers, (2) \nEnvironment shoppers, (3) Efficient shoppers, (4) Leisure shoppers, and (5) Convenient \nshoppers. Hypothesis and chi-square tests revealed a relationship between the factors and \nclusters, which represents sources of competitive advantage for each store format, and \nformed the bases for constructing a conceptual framework for retail internationalisation in \nTaiwan. The framework is the thesis\u2019 major contribution to knowledge in providing better \nunderstanding of Taiwanese consumer patronage of store formats - this has series \nimplications for global food retailers in the broad area of food retail internationalisation. \nThe major limitation of the thesis relates to the fact that there is a limited extent to which the \nconceptual framework could be generalised across emerging economies in the Asia-Pacific \nRegion. The issue of generalisability led to identification of the following two key areas for \nfurther research: \n\u2022 Testing the conceptual framework by widening the sample size to cover other cities in \nTaiwan and other emerging markets. This would make the framework more relevant \nto the Asia-Pacific Region. \n\u2022 A comparative study to identify trends in grocery shopping behaviour involving \nhypermarkets, supermarkets and traditional markets in Europe and Asia.", "authors": [{"name": "Chia-Shu  Lin", "ids": ["2146084059"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations":

An Empirical Study on Attribute Ratings and Customer Groups", "paperAbstract": "The paper investigates the underlying relationship between service ratings and customer types based on hotel review data collected from Tripadvisor.com. Comprehensive statistical analysis has been conducted for the overall and six attribute ratings. The results suggest that there exist significant differences on the mean rating among different customer groups. In particular, Business customers are the most conservative while Couple customers are the most optimistic on average ratings. Further, the paper examines how each customer group weights different attributes towards the overall rating via regression analysis. For all groups, Service, Room and Value account for over 70% of the total weight, while distinct priorities exist for each individual group. Surprisingly, Hotel Star has insignificant impact for all groups of customers. Additional managerial insights have been developed between independent vs chain hotels and 2-3 star vs 4-5 star hotels. The study highlights the importance of customized service design among different customer groups.", "authors": [{"name": "Xiao  Huang", "ids": ["47933132"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Chun  Wang", "ids": ["2108896315"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Chengwei  Zhao", "ids": ["121681985"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2017, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/377e98b78046284ce9469587aa6c63024da90d63", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.2139/SSRN.2903019", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.2139/SSRN.2903019", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2595332684", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

{"id": "eed2bf8de88dce71e694e161ef3ba91b9899a090", "title": "Relationship between community capitals and governance: The perspective of local actors in the Maya Biosphere Reserve", "paperAbstract": "Abstract Internationally, the decentralization of forest management from central government control to collaborative stewardship by local communities is gaining popularity. Forest decentralization is seen as a means of promoting both conservation and community economic development while decreasing government agencies\u2019 management burdens. However, not all community forest programs have been able to successfully achieve both forest conservation and socio-economic development. A growing body of literature identifies under what circumstances local groups can collective action dilemmas in resource management. While a wealth of literature focuses on institutional influence in common-pool resource management, recent research emphasizes the need to understand both how the local context and local governance structures influence community forestry outcomes. The goal of this study is to understand how governance and community resources interact to facilitate or impede the establishment and management of community-based forest enterprises. This paper addresses this question through a cross-case analysis of community forest enterprises in the Maya Biosphere Reserve. Results highlight the importance of social capital reflecting a growing body of research that has found that local-level network-based relationships are an important factor that either facilitates or impedes community governance processes. In addition, for many attributes of good governance, the resources that are typically seen as the most difficult to measure such as cultural capital, human capital and social relationships were also seen as having the greatest impact on governance.", "authors": [{"name": "Megan  Butler", "ids": ["143652771"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Dean  Current", "ids": ["2081716229"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["0d088aeb2220cd9bab0d9ce839b2845dd253bcb6", "f2c9d687211f4c293ba9e2bf1d9c761165472256", "24975c2f2bde4a81ce5af59eff6cdb64fca89b8b", "7ce5b04fb7acdb749014092333927eb34a64af43"], "outCitations": ["52374b87fd3694d889bbe60e1e41bbb4e97aa061", "17f5725e0cfde84b7fc90736f9b211c38a7eabf2", "e246772a3e4cef91c9f7772a7ba6c4c73804deb9", "2f8e19494f8ecc652e1dba60039b03b70787963e", "272e9af58713947b917a1d5eb4cfbe8c93e8f5bb", "82a6f618f986a888f68c40797fc88a0595cafdce", "305ae73d1ba288ed8dcbf6d07f0ce714199880f9", "d6ca6e230030ff9de97d325cd6838e40f7898103", "5323d9743bc9715654e2e64a9b8117bd8647a26c", "683343337c14ede5261c95ed2d68ef7103079594", "042738e5183ce8eebf2b72b58518639b08535cda", "b1617a3fd216f1f67d7621a74e6e2a6276903f80", "f46bab51fac6451b655065039155e609b5f512ff", "b695c90fcaa25c2dddb65fcd7f97faf9b7d1c314", "125cd4aa2cb5b50d443555feefd5514f540f3c1c", "ebf6392094371036691d89862abd2a7e96705e7b", "8ba28993b614ec8ef43209ec1d49a78655f24faf", "76929b8c9011ca713f10d105ae3c69b73ec3c619", "022f9390098883e579a3fff60ee9301284272346", "43a41b17af85fa0fbfb09eb392336788fbbdbc10", "87595a0bbc81f16322d5d7ff0be2c925f59648eb", "6cd9791ee0c4480dccdd933031be5c4bb01c32e0", "c7c711b8be4d0adcc422cf4dd8377413c31d76d8", "c6341e06b30ad5ebb01fc872a768351def2d8966", "90e2b72b309c73849ff6d21e83504c8ba7f2424e", "79db5c136b47efab5144a03c4240a5acc7d4a062", "721b15574555d91230a165c873851ed45d4d1eaf", "7db380119db0dbea950e8fe8de15408109933377", "60b1d0bb41fa667f30a4b4167bfc9bb9a799e531", "545eeb121511f687156bec0566bdcd01d275f1eb", "e6b50c07a89033074a12b3f740c2a60002f5b9c1", "4960c5546715cd41e8a55b5967059870f932bce4", "43912d4ff1a3be055c31c6cba2786bf24aaa7bba", "1c6dc838cfcb7c1928e9192c171289a864258da4", "f6028dddfb0d6e219c7fcfc62b8c44264cb57cbc", "70133f18b1e361651caef3ad20adc886915a9131", "aea5b1af0bfec56b7111bb70a3d0cb7a811d687b", "07c84a5182c0eda8773bf4137d6bb4eed9e2f242", "a0096e557e36fc4db319f7162de0c776b2d51291", "436d033effc865a639ba8ea529a4349ba37e58c7", "05c270b087e2e9888ea8a8cb5fff5c94d9edaaa6", "8409b56185cb900be62bdc419e5ecc5175fad3a3", "3c349839f6cf53dfd9222dc267773f139869c499", "3107591f814ffbcfc61cca7125c27882d5150fda", "c9aece346139711b8c65c618da99cdbecb162575", "6d38ab8657b5fee80da1793e9d896f66517c09f6", "e087ab865aec043e6bd5caa458041bbe18c32654", "493e7408b1f3e412424bdd9033dccb68ec2cd5a1", "3344cd448499dc9efeb21d118ae7b19453b83744", "379ffd011c11510b0ea4bf6b1940f7f5603af6c6", "c8764ed80a7ee52a08396f08d6403e5f82ffadff", "f3587ee62e0355184fd1098f8e20d1b991719a77", "6cb3f2d4b2d8cbfda0a93873b08400a5c84b3354", "2b933836310ca2a354df5011b7be9c058393b5de", "8c1d647ff347b0743f01b3406016ffff28c9d1ba", "2446d0f4f9c6635274c9629d5681669d0f4363df", "c21b17f04d3ad60e63a661f74c75c43240e796f4", "419a2bcc5808dd32613ba1e1f1723e154ff0ed56", "fde7eb2f98aaa321cbdea86f1e55cbf86c1dfed6", "b4b61c224b9b97c8d1f04ad0a124b6d4db615a6c", "f91d3215704f0644f73b8885485b36f3a8634079", "39c3a529768cd7fe77e178cae10377085c84cfc8", "26383a6c87a81629bd61a70c1d371f6e9b31bb6f", "e0eee2cf993de3644939ccf31f4e5b7b272c8f70", "88544625f5a0be0b291f9fbd5397e7ee12de1acb", "c3a8b96906dadf85510f5f6abe04220c22f867ca", "4693434e1cbbc73dc6b87578593e7bd383011da9", "a8cad95b5f62eaccfa02dde2c6679ce163e38c29", "9f7aeda62b20438a2d726445cf709fec135df6a0", "6654290a8d8097f6193cc2fffee318ac09b5036b", "2971e1c972f63f3e05279528b43d0e0002485d19", "3637c05a3e4b70e4a2b4d8b250daf96499787031", "8d55c55a6dba5987f5146e431aa26fed6fe1a001", "93d6380635a06b41a1423373b92decb5e037ad8f", "b7261c3a47a97d8a43448326a7196bd7646d307e", "ec18a6d5d45b7199fdcdb40118a208f4546e7161", "c82b143ba5d86308575bb29c4bc73138e2d39a17", "0eb2e42aa64f131be0fccf9052e678c28d9030b4", "d8dbaa59ad4f7cca59354d22a5fb2db164b3bfa9", "9a89355ce75027337b0270d7f32a362ebd1f5b20", "9b187edd1734676a59feaa1ab4226cce5153c6c7", "7b0bcf6cdc32145823c3afbf42b2afa31f89e5bc"], "year": 2021, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/eed2bf8de88dce71e694e161ef3ba91b9899a090", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "World Development Perspectives", "journalVolume": "21", "journalPages": "100294", "doi": "10.1016/J.WDP.2021.100294", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1016/J.WDP.2021.100294", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3125579322", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

This research examined whether or not the possibility of increased volatility evolved from economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 prompted Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) to adjust their corporate risk management strategy to one that is more accounting responsive. Based on the results of this research, BHCs\u2019 which increased the level of accounting hedges and decreased the level of economic hedges experienced a significant decrease in earnings volatility relative to pre-SFAS 133. The findings suggest that BHCs\u2019 ability to reduce earnings volatility and increase earnings smoothing to meet analysts\u2019 expectations after the 2008 amendment of SFAS 133 has an adverse impact on BHCs\u2019 continual use of economic hedges. Analysts and investors are recommended to evaluate further BHCs\u2019 risk strategies to gain a better representation of their risk paradigm with derivatives. This study extends prior research on corporate risk management activities of BHCs and contributes to social change by presenting new affirmation to investors of the influence of SFAS 133 economic hedges on earnings volatility.", "authors": [{"name": "Veliota  Drakopoulou", "ids": ["121884827"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["cf022c3b34cb7b05bc0833a69d7112ff61b24d1b", "b59e60bae4f3f004e2884df2f5238413cccddb01", "32a4f2e42c5999f06cbb70715f7d52bd899d2ba8", "cc4f95cc1114c397dd7329f87b0f44427bb2d3d2", "55f4eaa4259e8cc7ba0cfef296ba82f5950231e6", "65054f425f56608d7d9e31a176c38e1f234b7792", "e0e970976b39c7d60ca054689adce0294565fb8a", "0fc376b4eee860d0cabbbdcd8431ceed0c1ec01c", "b2b397f0f4899087bfb3a549b83c7b0e6e02c3ef", "69ac48846c95a7cdaffa3ec8e1ab53c8f3ad711c", "4f8b7d50592899c2c631a008aff2be0334c7ae82", "199384630242bcb7b72f21707d5af8389be1a461", "c470879e53e5f7ee6195a0bae184becb7436627b", "c42bf0ebf98758925e5515d760a66e47e180c42e", "f968586ddbe244aa5319ef8bf463bbc7930e95d3", "9d9e00634d1d20e85b4c99ec5c0d35c72b1917ac", "7c27128f4e6fa6eb19c58e5176bbaff00040dfeb", "82f70eab5ef10a16ee9a9e29725ecf9066fd2ca9"], "year": 2015, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1552f20538db18e96b99253eb02ee3b6e6a55b08", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=ww-business-admininstration&httpsredir=1&referer=", "https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?amp%3Bcontext=ww-business-admininstration&article=1001&httpsredir=1&referer="], "venue": "", "journalName": "Risk Management eJournal", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.13189/UJAF.2015.030202", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.13189/UJAF.2015.030202", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "1760431464", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

In the retail industry there is strong competition given the large number of businesses operating in that market.Therefore, providing high-quality services is considered to be a basic strategy for gaining competitive advantage in this industry. High-quality services lead to greater value for the consumer, which provides greater loyalty for a particular retail outlet. The aim of this paper is to point out the interdependence between the elements of service quality and consumer loyalty, using appropriate statistical methods. Retail outlets owners can use this to create business strategies for achieving great performance in this market. The survey was conducted electronically on a sample of 179 subjects. The survey results indicate that all identified elements of service quality affect consumer loyalty in retail outlets and that customer relationship and the prices of products and services have the most significant impact on loyalty.", "authors": [{"name": "Dragana  Toma\u0161evi\u0107", "ids": ["4686119"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Dragana  Ga\u0161evi\u0107", "ids": ["65953975"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Marija  Vranje\u0161", "ids": ["38336461"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["4b15a899a775740dccd3cf7022844c25dc7c84cb", "6d0dbef713fc2e1bd2a2574f283e1119df1c69e7", "9b6a6865381b56a750da18dec99243eb69318315", "679874727f75f2472435f73702d6e75561ac3334", "ea3b7e5490ef54e464038d4f25fe4b43a92e9624", "35fa6401175437e440c583b14ee481da7213231b", "bca532f5aa439df3dc2582987596ad85cc5d6411", "1d371785fbb37ea0ff83da40c7ac03fc68cbd257", "4a20cddc9df6a9445f4396c4a3c1eed646eb9b09", "be93def3d360b5287952dd4f934e22b6ece2acd2", "c3aef7b8cf4d5c3ad6063eb453712cbe70406346", "63e6411e6c0aac8217439dc7637e9d7b7d3a0a04", "a35d0a3dbbbf6d2e57ad6d2731e13dc3f5700f14", "38fdab214ffa45cdb94b6cca42e3276e524d81bf", "215f297c165826090efb1829324634d8685c5602", "1aaa957aeefc9ee02aba42de691b032deac474e5", "6f04f4f5271664518e71cad505698885d9e1978a", "16e2742425e3491b3f407a5498428ce5753c8389"], "year": 2020, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b4ff00c6ac81d623c32f6741f22476b56114ec2e", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "Marketing Science", "journalVolume": "51", "journalPages": "121-130", "doi": "10.5937/markt2002121t", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.5937/markt2002121t", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3090216049", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

It plays an important role in social development as it improves people\u2019s living standards in urban as well as in rural areas of Pakistan. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), up to 2017, 45% of Pakistani are living without electricity in rural areas. In Pakistan, load shedding is always a critical issue due to hectic energy threats, which are alarming for development especially in rural areas. Currently, there are 10 hours of load shading in cities and 12 to 14 hours in rural areas. There is a need to implement innovative, less costly tools and materials that can convert fossil fuels into renewable energy resources to generate electricity to overcome the load shedding problems in Pakistan especially in rural areas. To overcome the load-shedding problems and to convert the fossil fuels into the renewable energy successfully, we have proposed a Rural Areas Interoperability (RAI) framework for analyzing the geographical and environmental situations, feudal system in Sindh, Balochistan, KPK and some areas in Punjab and suggest a suitable renewable energy resource out of existing renewable energy resources i.e. solar system, wind energy, hydro energy, biomass biogas and thermal energy in a particular area to generate the electricity after analyzing the security issues for installation of these renewable energy resources in the specific area of a district in Pakistan.", "authors": [{"name": "Shahid  Naseem", "ids": ["48970297"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Muhammad Irfan Abid", "ids": ["153057489"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Muhammad  Kamran", "ids": ["2038008338"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Muhammad Rayyan Fazal", "ids": ["72598475"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Ghulam  Abbas", "ids": ["87417199"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Muhammad Rizwan Abid", "ids": ["145828898"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Zunair  Zamir", "ids": ["2006793495"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["277daba6a218f6cd3452b2b2b910ccd3f2f150a5", "792f66b9885880c711fe88eba7a9fac710236fe2", "4acad079f5563a5d9edcd0dfdc91e755725f81a7", "b73015188c3b710d4878b16da78e7f1e889f5a2b"], "outCitations": ["9710b469bc330845cae4e7530678270d1ee76fcf", "0c60897d9c57b5cf4edf4f392253573deab72641", "df251a8956953deb9cd0013b66392bee74891ace", "0cc36f4461e725b66372d51aa350f4ca6cee016c", "234c8c4ea2ef04031ed9192d857a276b88ab3fcb", "fb4641cf6b8bd395f08ae26c116628ed8ba2e2ba", "4d7dafb19564680cd0637c575d88b8716d76da34", "eb4bb71e4e420f075aa7ba338d726e88af64fddf", "7f3686d10b84fb3916bd7d66262ede8ee356d3a7", "98c2d2c85f05f42214be711d79aae26d42a44393", "0b87c84fc64c182db601592ebd959b7a37cab051", "7b4c35a0362b888d2a9c7936028b5c6d279e5b3f", "ab6478a24cf8f82547ac37d6a259f1294a097c1f", "53e204542fa79cce04c1691ffa623fe4500fefd6", "505bf8b41e03db58136060cc493c248790ae55aa", "2b0192a6d8e6ae85ab674e1039affff1b9be9144", "9e3b186f8a1dd05f5e4498eabf469a8048a12cd2", "b5bf3732f240a611bfcd75ebbf36da7e877bf820", "50d55f83c37f353c1e54f60ef6b2990e6627f87f", "57169c8fd77f13adacd5f1344ef63d7722b2a5d8", "70e84c9920649957b6f3d1b3bfb3340838a4f799", "ebbe3223190b88153fa0eef8c66af4962c653bc9", "deb00390107f42a06b281f13a4ba3fa0f1808075", "fbb2782b8de8e93fe9c83cdab79783bbd0be02c0", "918cc46892dd155d2bcb70b5e374069771a23919"], "year": 2020, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2e13a00014c05c353c30ddfc120e37736b744082", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://ijsmartgrid.com/index.php/ijsmartgridnew/article/download/93/pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "43-55", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3037790556", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Starting from the fact that the employment rate of older workers in Slovenia in 2011 was the lowest in the EU, the article aims to establish the level of older workers\u2019 job satisfaction in Slovenia compared to the EU, analyse its dimensions, its specifics related to age, gender, sector of economic activities and type of profession, as well as ascertain what determines it the most. A statistical analysis of the results of the Fifth European Working Conditions Survey of 2010 reveals that Slovenia ranks 15th among the EU member states in terms of older workers\u2019 job satisfaction, thus lagging behind the EU average. While Slovenian older workers, the same as their European counterparts, are most satisfied with doing useful work and the least with their prospects for career advancement, a comparison with other EU member states shows that they are relatively dissatisfied with working conditions, salary and adequacy of the motivation to give one\u2019s best performance, and relatively satisfied with doing useful work and with their colleagues. The analysis also shows that the level of older workers\u2019 job satisfaction in Slovenia is determined most by their satisfaction with the adequacy of the motivation to give one\u2019s best performance.", "authors": [{"name": "Aleksander  Aristovnik", "ids": ["1740164"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Ksenja  Jakli\u010d", "ids": ["116520898"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["648ba8ecdb384588e01d97c47358a4e01bc33a0e", "33e1d217dcf59fea4c95e375b1cb063b15dc4613", "cf0d3d3ad8ceda7530aef9fe7fef1afe0dad731b", "32a9a7365b495447b50efb379aa187bcf96a430e", "81850dbe8c5436b69b559d04354436cd1143b0f1", "3eca2133693265272ecd746c993c6c9e44bc215f", "af572d5115ce5f68b3bcf021f282054bfff3f363", "c3f55ff44656c3c748222c9ee93d87c43ffabb76", "98f3fcab865ee5145e425fa014333cace63c3d7b", "ad9ee7b8ca7155b9652de8476320f44053263fb8", "abf6a9521bd7af0c11f10dc72d4af4e73a36a5b2", "fdb24d12bf524a44caf36718b65734040964b365", "fb8e04d45d97cf5822f472cacfd057d4d60b39d4", "0ca6718b6a0d79a60d7bd6b5c893c63e01911678", "754992c7489cd273dd5249ea2cbd3de8de2880bd", "6a7178480ea82601c7565a73152b47d6f897f0bc", "59c92b88169c836fd0197c7ec15bb0cb367c8f11", "2181e36e7ee57f05747c443fd947ba12bea4a2bf", "fc80d0923e21e194298e9acb86408c40f6191fe3", "cd85f43b00e9d38dfdd61b5a5581f45bba30f350", "01327718ffcebacdfa39eb6af987665289bf0f7a", "148cc312cf697778853abb3a9708c53c740a9ef1", "4ec1654d55d1ef6a3ff6fecc28ed893cb98ad02c", "189faca57a5b71c9ac36fad919df4f3c19d7782d", "5c17b323a54c9ff198ce5fb8cf7190e5ea25981d", "8aaeeafade995034ceaa9759d8a21461d78aba50", "21e7e96fd294c5dfc58a966c33579563f7264b60"], "outCitations": ["c13188ae1e0a24a12d74293bb3bdae5a7d792e41", "99d48f216edd0e1c8c8537cc03816b64871e93b8", "9fbd058485b8803eed7f2ffb163c4009e9089f05", "b381a0515d937e23a8386b201d0ad02aeec41ea3", "1282d5e9861ff07bb8b438a4b862238b019a379f", "7f023680ccc9e97143db48a3c04828314784b8ad", "28878f11d2ba09ccacc2e772f8b4d92035f37268", "22b3b61a12a63c53aa0e3c71b84614c29d3075fd", "c3f55ff44656c3c748222c9ee93d87c43ffabb76", "f6387037184a7119dc93e2ed79b3447bd34ff74c", "7bb533515164e010e52a8066a752e774365c3160", "fdedf71fcd5d3212a70eecbc9e99d864cea581bf", "1780671970cebe08c5cffff461258ed84cd07212", "8bed43dd3745ae0770618c3c047425326a8d3fe2", "767cbb795d31ac5b937f1ddd5e14736d7c595a0e", "597d9a0ba9426ae1b9013325b834c86bd9220bb6", "fb94dd03fc3405b6e36220056db36fb3fd62f5f2", "2b57b1c427d4bbbdca3a3b9e02a115db72201ca3", "6f3d61e581039132fe4743eca62b71d310336ffa", "82fbb12557aceeba7d1b575c10733fe5853bcd8e", "60cece18f3f680ffeba1328836996b6fc57f8c81", "683fdee3e399e29669c8fe50b1d45e5cf1014ce6", "cb3daeb24e060596ccef1711693f98287eb96290", "b28f9c8317d88ce5949834abd6700b3de3557bdc", "14c79e974c658a8c1a15079d7a5f86a952a839d4"], "year": 2013, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/493f7bfbd601c2b895976739ac7c59560740c631", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/48809/1/MPRA_paper_48809.pdf", "http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/157484"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.3935/rsp.v20i2.1126", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.3935/rsp.v20i2.1126", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3021469034", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

According to one line of argument\u2014the \u2018network view\u2019\u2014the continuing high sensitivity of international trade to geographical distance is associated with a shift in the composition of trade towards goods requiring more extensive information exchange and personal interaction between buyers and sellers. An alternative explanation\u2014\u2018the market view\u2019\u2014contends that improved availability of information and increasing transparency of markets have facilitated the matching of geographically more proximate buyers and sellers, and that the observed decline in average transportation distances is a reflection of increasingly efficient markets.This paper examines empirically the merits of these two arguments based on a longitudinal analysis of bilateral trade between 25 major trading nations for the period 1962\u20132008. It compares the development of the relative importance of \u2018psychic distance\u2019\u2014a proxy for information related transaction costs\u2014and geographic distance\u2014a proxy for transportation costs\u2014in three categories of goods.The results are broadly in support of the \u2018market-view\u2019, showing that the sensitivity of trade to psychic distance has declined dramatically for all categories of goods. The impact of geographic distance has increased markedly for homogenous goods, whereas for more differentiated goods it has decreased mildly.", "authors": [{"name": "Lars  H\u00e5kanson", "ids": ["3299089"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Douglas  Dow", "ids": ["48555007"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["ff1b8d42cda2861eefe9ecc073625d8ba8a194c7", "4a474521f4f129994339912a12a8958ea838d17f", "7f1bd115087af7f0bf1d4d6fcffdd78751b0cd85", "5d4654a89c1aea4a26653b062f518a46b4f45511", "3829e2b84c2354c34a46286ccb5f7f8a8445768c", "310f8571131b91a937a8aa95c202dd5ed1e363ed", "898384bcdaee93ce368d1e05c44f001b004a452d", "af804bc66b86455621af21616bcd487a83a8f8e3", "ac9a457144b1e1a240189a6c27e837140461b76c", "cc234b46aeb5650661fc677373876c55857a869a", "2e70ccdc393b06018c9dd53fcf9b08f3b880667a", "3f268301300ec0ee3ba2709e485acad5a889f66a", "847b8206b8d1cfb8820a50db2f52181ca3687f0c", "04d24dabf24d3bb6488259c45011b39322982979", "390b2a88cd1c3539ed40e882cd4a603808bdaa4c", "ddc9d6696f2a0911251c5b561f0285bf71f0edfc", "e06543dcdf20e5b669750d902830629a892bf857", "55fcdc0dbf0c59ee1a6875bab84a4dcdfa218487", "d36b21cb2db786f10ceff48c0701f28e5f3067f4", "8f4b9d94fb0ef154b5449f535f6d69f99815b92f", "e14185bb423d8b8acf331e9ad8e55d901af88ebd", "aef09b367fefbd8539bbef3bd0be1703a6f6fe30", "fb5b34d328ab83420554273cb9cbab899bef28a8", "a2841c48111f9d06c7f8a223f37f75c9c25c5138", "cba461587f96dc7b34a3a3476a48259827189d45", "cdaa1f35bb0e37b29cefca8df64839809905da2b", "fdbe3521a685680478878784feb15b0368f3fccf", "d3e4ee12e37e3330340c5eb1fd2e8430d15a1296", "4b562d777d24738738336ad6962f2e542079b98a", "6242100a86b36a4d83b562d7f1efaadd522d83f4", "5fbaca2eb1fd5018a2e1444bcb617ce691939335", "7422ac76d7b7b5f53e20b25a332059d4163ac9b9", "0f6f1159276085cb785b70541273c94face3a801", "9eb091240a1d9caaac0df5b0c6da72ac12e9f2bd", "1c9bc0efcaf44f417ab8195c43df9cbe4cde7779"], "outCitations": ["edb0db3350f4574e48cb2eb266c2d3163455379c", "f3589b22832f1bcd090d63cf6e012bb223c55de7", "180398d5e8a55057447031754d2cf7ea52e6a6a4", "00cc5db5f59da9f338e990ca031eb9530bb2695e", "4089d3314f18025e5052c958cb05827eaa215a61", "bf9570f49c4dced0ba33c82504dfb63f068b37c3", "7a97eca4a28e425b036022d097d52576592642e4", "c26f49a8bdabb8394971e60679d580277e6d5304", "a38f894e9525400fc63740771ea063be76ab47f3", "d25fa9b1fd650f05f4daa9c9cb00f8d704906f1d", "1815920189887fb6b609cedf33a9a9664ed892fc", "b403fd157a93b419efb1c4b2d2a3b305558345bd", "a16a48b4cd14892fcf4dbee0594a1c0b6d183953", "eaf0fbe3d5937c681b40851d12f099a053769218", "72c77894cc19fd5ab73629a0041b58da5de2c389", "64e615b056af07231871c5833e5a1f90d1b9ed54", "7edadeea92fe1dfc1b8e399419e948b6b4ff7a45", "d78ee72bab8684b21a2aa0b60d283fabcc51744a", "6390e6043cbd50349c9a8c6cc5245713fd19f58e", "1d77ea79f5c4160f2f9bc3517fe46cb23997b86a", "bde5ebd1434f654401d527e748587840829016de", "2c03ce8643902f64fce2c33b6098405063c431d4", "12c8e59c737ce1a77df8a1d7e3396a5d60c5b501", "2cd79b42cc9809f98cbc9085b402a17b6770bc52", "8164db74915d63f6108702fe5354330e5700e54f", "ce8c0d9e95ee12247b7502f246903062ccfb4c0e", "913b7e8175da94e111f8dc7564ba7bba1964aac2", "0c12926e6d94c3866e16178a10ad22cc2df0d2f6", "9e6872cd4cab6f02c237eb37deea92cbc1cfd3cd", "5098d6a260aa109809333b260d7c90d259ccff1e", "63dc6912c0b103c578a4c88783dad4f707c088b2", "24b0712e1e40d9e8a6e595c9c08c8d221fbb83d9", "5ee2510b575e01ff45be8bba2e44edc58dec22d6", "fd3cd15ccfc510c48f980a621e40f0216f0520f8", "e2100412d72a3cf882f5e6bb453652f6896088b7", "9b25f097fe738e53bb3aaf4b0ae2ab2a61b73da8", "f52b5e33f7f83747b3ee858467ab5199e8fbd84d", "6d9b5830ce9123347409738736750ec45a1a3ec3", "42bb5515fb1d0e6c4755f83122c58546964c8e91", "a99e8ceef5e122c788ec804f812976e1cf773f45", "2e554de8013d8db18be0f1588f82d1510bc3f85e", "0ec059de7611f461c433f9062f52a56c241df8e8", "8d8563bffbf755efb5533e120327759c850e6751", "ffb64ee02b9b768f4c16132bff7d4d1f8f08cfca", "fa56cf06c2f6d87ba0e72a909bc66f8950194256", "7acab92266e8cc64519bb365661fb5e66ad7f1b2", "47f297206d7a1342252fadfbd7c2578912b97fa6", "bdaaed5017c77bc722555e4bb37a03ec711eba23", "c30ab378d5c2e3f5b687b86bb1139f2e22f7e678", "944714ae843f69144d075f898164fa5b26595d8f", "8ed9fb7594c8f568f5178678619e080feb271eee", "70ea4d9cf2056aeb50c11c40092fbc7de8c260c3", "bb234d46739aac33c4490c96ecb25b471c63793e", "9b3c6b2863b81ba4eee707f303f2727b311eff8a", "35a2afcdb1e140e61a95a90d1a4fc20d938a28ba", "1dd3d08ae52ca4b22e0821f06f3e0ad61550a327", "137b2af10c78136dc469e8b252610a9ecd8be11d", "03e959145438eca69573f5f5a0e5e8a57a7def4a", "7f7e852cfeedd1e9ad779c47f71dfe90ccb7c2a0", "807d4897cc84cb5f278ab541db891798d427f322"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b6f6180fe122aa37c42ab8449f5084e341585910", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "Management International Review", "journalVolume": "52", "journalPages": "761-789", "doi": "10.1007/S11575-012-0142-3", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1007/S11575-012-0142-3", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics", "Business"], "magId": "2173843832", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Moreover, it strengthened references related to the implementation of e-government in realizing public accountability to local governments. The data was collected through a survey by distributing questionnaires to the head of the Regional Apparatus Organization (OPD) in the Regional Government of West Sumatra and processed by using SEM-PLS statistical tool. The result of the study showed that the factors raised in the TEO framework can determine the implementation of e-government but is not proved for public accountability. The positive and significant impact of implementing e-government can increase accountability. Therefore, it can be proved that the increase of accountability can be achieved through maximizing e-government by each region.", "authors": [{"name": "Siska Yulia Defitri", "ids": ["2091986087"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Asniati  Bahari", "ids": ["121636422"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Hefrizal  Handra", "ids": ["104504812"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Rahmat  Febrianto", "ids": ["144132288"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["6e4ba16ed8e7bc7c01adad35387f9baa406c25cb", "c3e3dde0e52d38ba8ac56eb246c2003936b4ccf7"], "outCitations": ["0a2e4ab0a12c3f335e2b510ad293179f56840c60", "3ef78882085947469660f50e6114d5166c352c7b", "14caf8254c80024a67b9c5871091514bfbe17f92", "e0e83467b068d8e3ce5a02a00209fd79ba742be4", "1284f7d81c74632954d4940df1249166379a257d", "ba408fb0ab6ae53f9be40d107859ebec78034df9", "066e7c13a5e09b058feb89e524d4e5fb6267504a", "820e6263f9f2e9dd2327df99c501189985dc20cc", "629ce9038b211ee4d2a7549c266b2f1246e0834d", "8e81c808132622ce2e47c4404a96aea56ca96abb", "f440b5fa3168f12d834d90f211e6d7d0e2576271", "f79b047043595c390b3324b9dfd86abb75be4cd5", "be2919a71305374b0c6ae3704edb20a99e6a6e49", "89af855962927fb89a673a221f6f394a6f3dfc6a", "667664caab176d89ebe5e6aa973c5b6d62210d68", "b06633227de4c59dd18361eaefae2c7f883067a1", "895302ed73b48d64265a74b9e619671d419ddf74", "0a954386b36717010e3b07391da43916afa72ad1", "abf0090d16ba47b4402a6693b0c9fa1febd5a3ff", "cf746b19701f18a1740c83bfc5adad247787fec2", "325ef79455000d7f48e8b2267fa41e7ecd12af05", "44cb72370fa7ec09a9cd00c5a5fd931d3756a085", "983038471b1379ff5a3d5b76d7ba54c541dc5f97", "e54a6e20e7208a00143412a0bf35e7f5f2964457", "915c16864443f52c8149aac4715022987b51da6b", "b8ef968a140e7270e012775cc64bff42b1860fdd", "5a5a41bafde2088856f6599522ae7f571cccd0cc", "3047e38e9e7d7580c51dc6ba8db55b51f875ee62", "fb515e45446e86e0c1f8049fb8ac0a1ea6838cb1", "f457186af1b9819f9e292d22126c5ec65f7f39f9", "856d3618d22b823f29625d9be36ae299525ec76e", "bb3d8af3e0fcba2654eb978ca31c887bb9b1a373", "2806acfd618c05a78fba6f23cdabcb177a5e8425"], "year": 2020, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fdde82e1955c850fe463dcd8bf56d4e2eb7994ae", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://ojs.mruni.eu/ojs/public-policy-and-administration/article/download/5273/5292"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Public Policy and Administration", "journalVolume": "19", "journalPages": "37-51", "doi": "10.13165/VPA-20-19-4-03", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.13165/VPA-20-19-4-03", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3121491196", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

In particular in the competitive, dynamic environment of today\u2019s worldwide business, an organization\u2019s innovative capability and successfully launched innovations can represent a means for competitive advantage (e.g., Hitt et al. 2005; Trommsdorff and Steinhoff 2007). Besides the focus on innovation in an enterprise\u2019s strategy and the evolving resources, capabilities, and core competences required in order to be innovative, a prerequisite for the desired outcomes of strategic competitiveness and above-average returns are effective strategic actions, which are embedded in the strategic management process (Hitt et al. 2005). Hence, strategy formulation and implementation are crucial for a firm\u2019s long-term success. In this context, organizational communication can support strategy formulation through interactions with stakeholders, for instance, receiving feedback regarding market expectations (e.g., Argenti 2007; Cornelissen 2008).", "authors": [{"name": "Nicole  Pfeffermann", "ids": ["94966295"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Michael  H\u00fclsmann", "ids": ["2943350"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["76e8834157e8055399e2eb56c40f682e5ea0ac97", "e019776672f1e382290e79b5f66a9d2ed8b2c724", "bda167537e0ed92e54dcb1d8d56023f9ce5697af", "8625b825dfd8edb06437ab6854192567d71a4393", "3e9f1c9deeb1b70f4404aa9a0953749da9fd6da8", "081f50007d0a13240c8bdcfdcd2011b7211c0dfb", "634595bf5de92cbcdb40ffecc102eb6454e4f287", "98c866fca6473ab62136477b7bd416b848f303f8", "00b7b0a63f2f3ba56312e898c5020fb61177c614", "cafe2972860a7cbb1913d8c06d3f87fae6466c70", "32a0782a96539ba752cb340b5fb34367756c3116", "45d07072517a4cbf7715f8f52250e90fb7a34f59", "56ff17cd5968efe933cc8b79fd50d639cd710005", "d318c4ec4ea0138eaeb62eb04b5c2e513c9140dc", "2bb015f9d414a1343ecf52442af4ece181f105b7", "04fc5d389522fddeaf7fdb595ae636009dc281b6", "2ecef02a42837dddff5de15126d07efcd0205a7d", "478411f0d738615c77e25cbf154976956e749923", "3ac8ac31abde8a9105fb15e67e018cd0e48dbef7", "48c6aa2c95dae6dfb3cf9be05d557c09f280de25", "236dcccd5c83bc9e7d76bc83a21109df5d8af7f2", "7311d5826220161ffd9a664c71148eb9af617345", "9f06ba81c1e8b0843fe4d0af02357991075ce275", "13b3c7a0f4506eb022817e8ede0ba108d7b00fa8", "cc805a7887a43a6f459ee1ccfb8e96fc045b0934", "af5f78b6fa1aaff159382f4d5fe8694c1fb8a1a1", "0b1f7a2298025670840156972e4a523c4876d076", "a61b9b9766c2e73051561bd07e60391ef3742d92", "28217d6c044fca11ab0af19002c2db67ce775d6d", "7801c54709dad54a99cc65b01a3f7f64e23cdd6d", "bbf8aa7bc71bc07e150b0b3bb694bfc93e76b29c", "15a42d7ee3481507b148b3d117887c3a44815335", "1f72a1f9dee1ab93a6fb6d1511218f6e438b7761", "10b603e1b7191ac7ed7967c0c065931be351a5e9", "92dbf877548410a9adf409c61978e85ab9e82747", "fb9283a21fbcc6b7fa88ffcfe20480f3efeafb56", "e112864848776c67124453fa8e58c98bf105f711", "ad7c2fd53d40b46d3c5cfba766805a0fa29c8852", "2d64b0a485da73d476fd133b55be57fb96888f8f", "17721ff02141443ec8e14dcc624cd26700f24719", "d68247de60412d2c9e821b9da1f4b0ff8b85e230", "abb25a9eaeafda5b566b2183d9a010016c923562"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7daf115b2a8fb2acb9bf7b4e905d2058942b5dbe", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "185-192", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-17223-6_13", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17223-6_13", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2194019957", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

It is assumed that an enforcement agency can make use of a costless inspection process, which would provide a free, but possibly inaccurate, assessment of the subject's behavior. The agency also has some power of punishment.When should evidence be collected by the agency, and how should it be used? How can an enforcement system be structured so as to maximize the level of compliance? How does compliance depend on the subject's private gain for violation, the level of punishment, the risk of errors (of both kinds) in the inspection report, and other parameters? These questions and others are addressed using non-cooperative game models. Answers give new insights into real-world enforcement problems in areas as diverse as environmental regulation and arms control.", "authors": [{"name": "D. M.

This paper analyses the innovation-productivity relationship at the industry-level for a sample of OECD manufacturing industries. We pay particular attention to the vertically-induced influence of product market regulation (PMR) of key input sectors of the economy on the innovative process of manufacturing and its consequences on productivity. We test for a differentiated effect of this type of PMR depending on whether countries are technological leaders or laggards in a given industry and for a given time period. Contrary to the most widespread policy claims, the innovation-boosting effects of liberalisation policies at the leading edge are systematically not supported by the data. These findings question the relevance of a research and innovation policy based on liberalisation.", "authors": [{"name": "Bruno  Amable", "ids": ["73069291"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Ivan

It has been estimated by the World Trade Organization that about 50% of global trade flows emerge through the preferential trade agreements between the countries. This trend indicates the growing importance of the regional agreements over the preferential or bilateral trade agreements between the countries as they are comprehensive and offer wider benefits. This chapter discusses the fundamentals of the integration process in the North American trade and economy and delineates how the market integration has been driven through exports, imports, and manufacturing investment made by the member countries which, taken together, have been responsible for 90% of regional imports during 2002\u20132012. The chapter analyzes the impact of market integration on the economy responding the pertinent questions that remain unresolved, whether the market integration through regional trade agreements delivers the desired benefits to the developing nations as compared to the one with the develop trade and economic conditions.", "authors": [{"name": "Rajagopal", "ids": ["3323647"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Vladimir  Zlatev", "ids": ["72462373"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["d7bcceada40878be994dc2099c6e859f91650f61", "4967f661a297f99ffc1de17d4674a335ef3bb384"], "outCitations": ["1405c413dfc76222560e3fb3c01ba7d4bfb8d965", "383c808773ebeb7412801d5c4302050ca43d685e", "a4c92e22cea87203843df84fe5a6b58f7996f3ec", "9764bd11b8134749dc631d9e50ae197a2e120c72", "84fed2574304f21928bb53e0c7ad69bc7cb9deff", "5610966f21626d801be00b1f09a0fd9e85961b83"], "year": 2018, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c25d095045291a26a0be7c3b8be1cd46d0c8c68c", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "55-82", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-57606-0_3", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57606-0_3", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2743745309", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

With the aim to identify factors that can facilitate increased product innovation activity, this study compared organizational characteristics and perceived barriers to product development among innovating and non-innovating strategic business units (SBUs) in the Swedish and Finnish wood industry. Multivariate analysis of data from a cross-sectional sample of 110 SBUs suggested that organizational size and educational level among white-collar workers are significant antecedents of product innovation activity. Furthermore, the difficulty of giving practical priority to development work in the everyday stress was identified as the most important perceived barrier to product development among managers in both innovating and non-innovating SBUs. A low competence level among the personnel and a low need to innovate was perceived to be the second most important barriers to product development among managers in, respectively, innovating and non-innovating SBUs. Practitioners who wish to increase product innovation activity in the wood industry are advised to promote an increased educational level in wood industry companies. They are further encouraged to seek ways to reduce the perceived barriers to product innovation identified in this study.", "authors": [{"name": "Matti  Stendahl", "ids": ["88366218"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Anders  Roos", "ids": ["35120013"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["ec68a45459956882c08ee2bda1074019b51aaca4", "f614d7693e1cd7d9feea23eaabe9abe7ce9fbb25", "101738a769948cb563904bd317af5d6f1351bbb5", "2e03fc641ec534188d77161f1c61e7f26f656885", "ed58806bf802e4e83ecafebac4fd3b92e3104f44", "1c14b088a9561720b749c7f3c7cf992d284ef32e", "c83bc746b8b66245a215cc15f4f255eee3b5889c", "c168ed3ed95fad8ae06014ed8739f699ab5773ff", "be03cc8ecfa80747b2261295b8d7c7f025b8a0d9", "5ee197b453a936c2764a3533c00202f007491d77", "71ba29ab45a360b9b4b634e086d74f6d18f3061a", "b4e5f9048218855413ee66e37faec329f01f50b0", "2c2c33c586493e0a080d62070c198a5f016e57e9", "81f8c06b29182ed647ce67e2ab63e10b67ff5f49", "aa1db8ed6ccfa14f81a983de460909386f5d07b2", "59eab07c2d062c58332c0297d9f17271bba97994", "1f5f921ff646f243e1d46d12036770b26d004eaf", "481fcf3b33669778ca9f83daf5d4208992462ace", "e16047a04ae55610de563b54630b29ebf64633dd", "6bf70922cc341e4be5b324cf54379a45cec67e47", "b206bcbe06f4c9f9bc216f24540f94d489914abb", "e04cb352c047083be73565d58a0e1e51b3175934", "71c3350673ef51a7329a76d9871d7a6347bdffd1", "2a9ebf3d13e01c8f4f8a99388fd0d1446d96eb6e", "5422e4d0667f862983afd0ff20858d0478c40270", "7293b6a2acd032c3f8f28ff2a348049cea9cba66", "0c1616a43cc819a544b2e15141cf5347a51a12ae", "cff44f2def41615c8b1550d2b23b556c936d7aea", "41b4f9f3fba6b2831eae1499a202866723fafff1", "dc02014a10f5ce4afa60b89df22fdf1b6405d599", "01c016b1c9de5f6f569c6d5c6d8f74fba6709abe", "9a4c8861efaaa0d9f2aa7f7e33c9ebb1b34aaf33", "d8c79f318f4736709a4a29a80b7b624edba4d14f", "43f6c4031f58c199c331b0ff504243b0ae945eab", "b103129c81fd0103e12635c2a0e19f9018ae6548", "cecab13e3fdf6c8b8b05e0314a717bed21b359b1", "cdd95a9a02315c66f2425b3f42ac7f796a87dd39", "4cb1cbb4dada77fa17d9fa05852275c13f595627", "8357adf495aeac6ff7c868342fcb8c97dd1d4326", "d92c972b0b83abc00c994e74783a847197368449", "990d5ed09f8a569d805f7f4d1375cfbc5c86fb51", "471c0f4d1abf7e0f6fea34da0981399a0df3ea05", "8aa607fccd7e649a9981eb02dc631c5acf50371d", "2cadfdd2a8b2bd1ebc19837f6d9fafea33974c3c", "65d633ad3e5b325e07c1f795d451b46d9f01b5e2"], "outCitations": ["63b63272f3174d2608fc0a7943d3c73910d67baa", "cf25d7a43d800af3dde159b98536e296c0fdc3c1", "8f53f3d9b99b00a44b8a1554c01bde274dd1ebe9", "e7aa23dde92e2d90af324f5a6003a14b970419f5", "2b5339cee1e0238ea0adc604432f90b2d265b365", "e35b28b818cf00b00c67deb1d3ff63da61b759f4", "e9f8f834951708ee2fedae3162478449eba3b2a5", "11dd1387e9dea8bd0e727bfa7015b4c208a6e75e", "98c866fca6473ab62136477b7bd416b848f303f8", "2d7e997c1d80ebc56e950790b243be0fd5eb70be", "8378ae8b107b4de9e2e1f876fbbcd919696238c2", "8989c5265f01d9eccf1ebc59ad64ef6e489fb980", "6d2730ba274307a40417cb86cad9c7ec4b9ba859", "dfaed89d0ee0058c0e0cd0327f0248f4260010ae", "96cecf7064d958124086bd1f8ce50d0660f2833d", "b9edbf079f1fa89abbeec5d401aaa7ead126b114", "c02cc0580d5f027e0e9c5ab26208fee4f9ab0077", "cb91582dcb220dee28e40c6b309d126e26d9202a", "a58a288c673fc2492de12823828a431d53ff9883", "c85844729d8d2041f72f8668a45933610da237e2", "00c67a6c7c38a95cd639846dbf764936713de0d9", "a92380d2cf43cdcf79756d13a559c474d4306b66", "40cf089c6bc6460ef28f2758b0270cf2f54517f5", "ff1b5a0746bd0635ec9f7100e7337abe0f3bfc81", "32d8703b5ca72fcad6357fd1b9bb12268f36bb86", "1e86c94394211760fab88c24ce70cb81c67b1860", "5a6bdaf36aba549ed84cc4dd261a291618e445bd", "cc3112d5e9824bb4ec038adb213c78cd3544c1a1", "64330a4744243ff2536b7be68f9e3bdcf022bad8", "289c908a376de1a4674e2c127e58a8b6194532d8", "67556c4f0cfdd1f09fff373768b03638f949be0d", "c395d0ac5115c0ffb4526ead0590e80dd83261d9", "ec7f3484c1750305929e15de297c1a0ed070fd33", "4f00585722361db8388cdc85b062995ee1f7d8d3", "7c44f826b0e8acea951c69373fd8c4e616a62e40", "a799e238849ec718eec6a0c1c3cd18446a3e6f65", "b06e5f2b0e532507d0e81494ead560eeeb7fa7e4", "f9fb60ece8b7e8b730ad61a55005c1b16d47dbaf", "ec51bff3416ed30038a919cfd362a15070d5d756", "bca52295627caa0fd78691482997afd4235f2df5", "7a2dbc2c3949286f4915db074366fcdbebce021a", "8162968fadfe2407bc8875aa37e47d3ec8fea447", "62280335152c573613948a79f1ee7b8264effd9d", "a162eccbe0e1bc6007104d7df17f0dde6b6c87e9", "5b79f4f2bd669168fa63a26785a54c96526e8ed5"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ecf8d028e69da098c76a90cdaa5de48538a38f6d", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.metla.fi/silvafennica/full/sf42/sf424659.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Silva Fennica", "journalVolume": "42", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.14214/SF.239", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.14214/SF.239", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2032522882", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

It is carried out on a sharing of profit and loss basis. Islamic banking operates on two principles called Mudarabah and Musharak. Many Muslims do not put their money in the bank thereby encouraging idle cash. Several literature\u2019s were reviewed to assess different authors view on Islamic banking impact in a country\u2019s banking sector. Questionnaires were conducted to ascertain public opinions on the Islamic banking concepts and its desirability in the Nigerian banking sector as well as necessary inference were drawn from such a survey accordingly. The paper recommends adequate supervision and normal prudential guidelines to streamline its operation. The paper concludes that Islamic financing as a part of a financial sector development strategy should be encouraged by regulations and supervision authorities, that accommodate its forms while ensuring that their unfamiliarity is not exploited to defraud clients.", "authors": [{"name": "Echekoba Felix Nwaolisa and Ezu Gideon Kasie", "ids": ["122304287"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["5d846b3a691b0c3969c2f111715f9a2b69ddb97c", "8ab34ac61c25e6d127026c615c4bdcd6d72ad337"], "outCitations": ["63da1213dd30ead6c34e5156f59b980fd570bfb0", "bc40d131d3edf733f00ad8403e7f29dc3a18d501", "b0a4521c2120204f26f6cda3531adb427f6ad1a0", "27e384d7c9fee1b4ae5b7c62373bf20a061a1b64", "5a436b032b4b2e21968e4af823cc4d9d04d85dda", "bd8b784a1ed3b80fd9411078413b1d4510814b07", "284726d1c7d9298db3a61a430e45f081789cfc0e", "7fcee9954f55068c41e2e690706157475d816ab7", "6c3e7cee28dc26c7b2f3f6d888841c9d4e4c2827", "3d878bcc1cc887161bb7143a4187ccd3e0169ade", "93465d654c7284eee69b5f6bee8f053c956d84c4"], "year": 2013, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6012a3c0945e7fe648a0f329fb793bff74ffd392", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.arabianjbmr.com/pdfs/RPAM_VOL_2_3/4.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Review of Public Administration and Management", "journalVolume": "2013", "journalPages": "1-4", "doi": "10.4172/2315-7844.1000119", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.4172/2315-7844.1000119", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2329430707", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Using a portfolio approach to all traded \u2026rms, I \u2026nd a strong positive relationship between distress and equity issuance. When the cross-section of \u2026rms is sorted by degree of distress, the mean monthly net issuance rate increases monotonically from 0.10% for the safest decile portfolio to 1.13% for the most distressed. Using a large database that includes both public and private issuance, I \u2026nd that the hump-shape distribution of public issuance and the monotonically increasing distribution of private issuance together represent the increasing CRSP issuance population in the cross-section of distress. Moreover, I \u2026nd that the low abnormal returns of distressed \u2026rms are concentrated in those \u2026rms that issue the most equity. Thus, the positive relationship between equity issuance is important in understanding the equity issuance and return patterns of distressed \u2026rms.", "authors": [{"name": "James L.

Accessibility is a concept in transport planning that is used to measure the ability of an individual to penetrate constraints to reach his desired activities. In the studies of the self-organisation process in the following chapters, the accessibility problems of low-income workers in urban China in overcoming constraints on reaching employment opportunities and non-work activities will be introduced. The low-income workers in the deprived neighbourhoods being studied experience self-organisation processes in which they use their individual decisions and actions to interact with the various government policies and social norms to achieve employment and housing. Many of them have to work long hours or face time conflicts between household duties and employment. As a result, they choose to spend less time pursuing non-work activities, such as social and recreational activities.", "authors": [{"name": "Joseph Cho-yam Lau", "ids": ["114221198"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["f0718833bac8c0a5118a75dfc5e8bb4f04f605ab"], "outCitations": ["af3f09b7231fad6c9d41dde3c3fc49e89a87492a", "189d4933061a9473c356d39b313fdf0388ecc564", "fd0fefc37d3cc14917ae44b6f17134a3cefeceaf", "955e4bb3458da74daf45b4a53273406cf3a55a22", "61fd4c1065cf4eaac1478b5b0c59aeb2f7d313e9", "60cb148a85cefe2aea4a3ab883f78d6142db1826", "d98badbb6dd99ca7de47cad9a76de4b16f8cd1fd", "b06e331504a1ee535cadfa3fa7966517b0150bcc", "1b56b075d76f9ca8351238ffce374da37e2a288b", "5b0312b58cb62934440fe5d4da612d1f7e1c741e", "5939769feba34741e45a2ffa9390ae95aeee3da6", "372fbd5aa0c547caa033a53ef6bcba55127dbf41", "b9788cfce76cc63de4b0a9759aa11518a818e4cb", "5f485a8d4bb1ae70c6e0f962f554de7e3ce8efab", "3c7f62c6e474d8bdcdef5d2d175455330ab7bada", "752eee5e3070323d24e55f522ce7995cc72ec108", "c0e624726b53bd3d86fae4605c5637bec4d93c23", "adc4dba82bf62c7d9fa6ec3552d1d5987ca4d268", "e0f9143f099aa826dadec1a5490acc0bb7b41ecd", "839ee81b14ab6ee9859c1e79bd4875ea58823891", "d1a50ad128b564f8f0d65d09d96cfb28fcf26f42", "4d2346b4a5330e67fe03dc27dbacfb4c1e326c99", "b370b8d4f4aa529cd1505b8d80e87d93ca500f1d", "9f3d53a7a929b42211394943fbe0d5ea67d8e617", "5150039fb0f93d5daa4d80e819df49b3c3c3b7ef", "e63973e7339d8be0d9234e70645b921b3364f473", "c4dd2aace7bf04cb5ac10fa6e10938072e8ae8c1", "ca55c0800e2ec75e2c69266b64941fecd2a27caa", "9e3a257c9173337da28f58dc6cd4a8d3a78b0512", "a99aadb58c97dcf74939e1059d761edd74bf91c6", "418f7e40875f328021c449a8341348547ff3abbf", "a34e2ed7fb5e9df66d4f11cbae888a8d9739f7c4", "be1800d3142292724fb7cd206354c7ff81b690d6", "f15b81739fdfef9ce9e9eb87315baa449ed12f94", "14e950c003a24ecc88c94cc61922608f61f312ed", "4c3b1b6192640a64c0b51120690c84de92ebc481", "dd089358ec4160c41b7eb752d76b487d2c5079a2", "d9aeecc58b18585273074a9785f7b5ab879ceb0f", "eddd22e7d49a1cabc49fbc01fa3f846e21465206", "15ca5359d3da483915a079895e3bb050d8fcb882", "5188a16ece4da908b034626b5145ca132cf125fc", "ccbd9809753dd1bd4c2261d5ef2f8dd6498dccb9", "ffc14157d684bbd94a30482e49020c5cab84d0d2", "50daad88e20fed285cd3762faa2a2d570fe8b8d6", "f552581f197d13b73cdd35ffd1bc560b38a5fc57", "c15465a78d0a9db65802d974b3971a88401a0c10", "39f13c7762f792f262844ff456322c78919913fc"], "year": 2020, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a1e42e02d98dbca836a87bd0d9adc2a06c0efc99", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "51-76", "doi": "10.1007/978-981-15-2252-9_3", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-2252-9_3", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3011098599", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

An empirical investigation", "paperAbstract": "PurposeIn this paper, the authors empirically investigate under which conditions production network management is effective to improve manufacturers' financial performance. For this, the authors explore contingencies between production networks and the three key dimensions of organizational environment.Design/methodology/approachA survey with senior managers was conducted for this research. The authors used a hierarchical regression analysis to test interaction effects and draw on follow-up interviews with chief operating officers (COOs) and senior managers to elaborate and explain the found associations.FindingsResults indicate that manufacturers' financial performance is only associated with their network capability level if they operate in hostile competitive environments. In moderate competitive environments, improvements in the network capability level are not associated with greater financial performance. In particularly munificent environments, such production network upgrades are even associated with the opposite effect.Practical implicationsResults highlight in which organizational contexts upgrading production networks has positive performance implications and under which circumstances it is ineffective or even counterproductive.Originality/valueThe authors draw on unique survey data to add quantitative evidence to the predominantly conceptual and qualitative literature on global production networks. This is also one of the first studies to connect the topics of production networks and organizational environment.", "authors": [{"name": "Oliver  Flaeschner", "ids": ["118524342"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Marian  Wenking", "ids": ["2096825227"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Torbj\u00f8rn H.

In this article, a project management model is proposed based on the continuous improvement of processes under the lean and agility approach, and a medium enterprise from the sector is considered as a case study. A 50% reduction in the lead time of projects was observed, reprocessing and overtime were eliminated by 70%, while quality was ensured and the probability of project success increased. Thus, the application of this model solves the problem under study.", "authors": [{"name": "Christian  Iberico-Tafur", "ids": ["1659406434"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Ricardo  Sun-Itozu", "ids": ["1659405408"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Maribel  Perez-Paredes", "ids": ["1430758067"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Nestor  Mamani-Macedo", "ids": ["2005853075"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Carlos Raymundo Iba\u00f1ez", "ids": ["38722049"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Francisco  Dominguez", "ids": ["1570738178"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["c404e337dec369a7f12439fdfd2bb27c4eccda08", "8ebbd46e43df4a6e7be076ae99747d2a97a52004", "2b91d9564762cc197860b4c60514249d33ad1c8d", "1bd25bfef98c3709992d5551bca204f062201e26", "62590f3068ea6af003032a19f3a4b918c399492b", "97f3faf84e1a7f9d04b78feceb9f34a71753b81e", "ce25e559e11cb1e964becd3e0376d17d58b9ca5c"], "year": 2020, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a0b675e18757e4b2de79888b63934519477cc531", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-44267-5_102"], "venue": "IHIET", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "676-682", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-44267-5_102", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-44267-5_102", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Business"], "magId": "3014675900", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Islamic banks seem much stronger to recover in financial crisis compared to conventional banks because of the inherent nature of Islamic banks, which prohibits the interest payments in all transactions. Thus, this study examines the efficiency level of Islamic and conventional banks during financial crisis particularly in 2007 to 2012. The efficiency of Islamic and conventional banks is measured utilizing Data Envelopment Analysis by adopting the intermediation approach. The data are extracted by Bankscope and Annual Report from 2007 to 2012. The samples \nconsisted of Islamic and conventional banks in Malaysia. The results indicate that pure technical efficiency contributed more to the overall technical efficiency of \nIslamic banks. In conventional banks, the scale efficiency dominates the overall technical efficiency. In overall, the finding shows that Islamic banks are exhibited higher technical efficiency compared to the conventional banks attributed to the higher pure technical efficiency. Hence, the findings of this study have policy implications, and make a contribution to policy-making by providing empirical \nevidence on the performance of the Islamic and conventional banks and their efficiency level.", "authors": [{"name": "Safiyuddin Fatin Syazwani", "ids": ["120375461"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["c9a733e5fc62ecd51b7889c6526446d6d1ed9fd3", "f7b8edcca9d8b3191317ce54424f1a508e125bde", "4e68cfef45dfdfdfc5b45749d9e51f78493ae41f", "465047f58e3194d5ec424d999395d88b86fab37f", "b0c2257da41f81ff73e1de4404c8cc1617f919e1", "0fabbafd513b701264ff87c5dd5da18e59e3196f", "54532a5e2a1b0df79205b807ee09125051433b3c", "18a67027176b2bc0650db2365b6c37302de5a42f", "9d265178ee4fa001b80326c4aa4d09384aafc061", "f6a50d008f33c15cafce2cbbf7dabcb8e648c0c0", "f34f7ce85f8c32a4adc837366377c99c4ca0b97d", "6bc5a92730e33f127827b3f857d30388eeb21992", "24436c9d4151b14bdd82d4ca78f022a9c6ffc04a", "dd940ef97c01f33fbada3d130b81ceb0694c3074", "baba5f8e321cb38a0f0290f0eae00982e7bb8f1f", "e781eb5d98639f576d026aba209ee87d21648822", "67bd49b51398e2d6b96b595f9537948495d973db", "e9e52b2a5c51eadbd1def6805b3cf4a7c60158f4", "5abec1c54f1a51121da1a72a47c4e75b87393449", "f959bc998e087b78a3fe9bf29f44c610bd0d0bfc", "1700379aa48d13678ea8d4e062645eeee1e0f0c2", "d35bdd824ebaf3546e7cbede14b42d70963dada5", "d2f4839c37f8152fd79108a370982f8094861084", "f9d9279fe6eec0ec53949971de6495c4844e2974", "6748328d6b32f9ab6a38d903058c2701b3cdceac", "28789d2f5924058976c83b8a570dd4953414af8a", "4a93e5edee99b9da945ce1b4c14eb3c9d04f26f1", "9d4ab12171c22474a23cd12eee8e37048631868c", "745d30feb374826f5ac654999d3ab06f635708a8", "f706bef8ef1e9320bd40b9f8cbe7f8d1def0fecf", "869dfd949425fcb2e303d76172b6edbb9b8bb2a6", "5a047ece8b2aed70d76e7e2bf7fbbcb913895fe7", "78ce096b94e608221c40e240e29bacbc8d67a179", "0727c4bf1ce76bd265bfb8380b976331f9f7bd97", "4e508f741a8ce68c46d652def6326875f1692a19", "cc4b4b95f8a40a63411ff51bb8053711911bd2d8", "d9f185bc3f7a0840c15cb49d6bd645f491307eda", "43bc6e9f4ba51c311eff1f0dbef5174724680af6"], "year": 2014, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c0acb4b8026bac03a944b1607fcf12818f8a053b", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://etd.uum.edu.my/4092/2/s812878_abstract.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "172530431", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

However, not all group members necessarily obtain the same benefits, nor do all pay the same costs. The net benefit of group membership is typically skewed in favour of some individuals to the detriment of others. In some cases this skew may be extreme, so that it may pay some group members to leave the group, depending on the opportunities available outside the group. More often, however, all members of the group fare better than they might on their own, even if some do better than others. Furthermore, the benefits and costs are not fixed, so that those that obtain relative low rewards at one point in time may be able to improve their lot subsequently. There are two main predictors of these cost and benefit inequalities within groups: firstly, the position that an animal occupies within a group, relative to other group members, and, secondly, the position an animal occupies within a dominance hierarchy. These factors often interact, with dominant individuals taking up the most favoured positions at the expense of their subordinate social partners. In this chapter, we first examine the payoffs associated with different positions in animal groups; we then examine how animals are able to respond dynamically to these by adjusting their relative position in their group. Finally, we examine the constraints that animals may face on their ability to take up beneficial spatial positions within groups with particular reference to the existence of dominance hierarchies.", "authors": [{"name": "Ashley J.

Moreover, the need to provide incentives for managers to relinquish control links aggregate capital reallocation to executive compensation and turnover over the business cycle. Capital reallocation and managerial turnover are procyclical if expected managerial compensation increases with the number of managers hired. The agency problem between owners and managers makes bad times worse because capital is less productively deployed when agency costs render reallocation too costly. Empirically we find that both CEO turnover and executive compensation are remarkably procyclical.", "authors": [{"name": "Andrea L.

Ample experience has been gained, especially in the U.S., where EEPs have been in use for decades, with the rationale of avoiding additional energy supply by improving energy efficiency. More recently, EEPs have been implemented in Europe and in Switzerland. This review paper presents insights from the U.S., the EU and especially from Switzerland, with a focus on levelised programme cost of saved energy (LPC) as a key performance indicator. These LPC values, which take the perspective of the programme operator, are typically low to very low compared to the cost of electricity supply, thereby representing an important argument in favour of their use. The country examples show that EEPs are being effectively and successfully put into practice, for example, in Switzerland both as (i) a national tender-based scheme (called ProKilowatt) and in the form of a (ii) utility-operated obligation-based scheme (in Geneva). EEPs not only call for diligent implementation but also for suitable legal settings, e.g., in the form of mandatory energy efficiency savings targets (as realised for energy efficiency obligations, EEOs) in combination with programme cost recovery. The main criticism of EEPs is the free-rider effect, which needs to be minimised. On the other hand, EEPs are accompanied by significant co-benefits (environmental, health-related and social) and spillover effects. In their currently prevalent form, EEPs allow one to effectively save energy at a (very) low cost (\u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d). They can hence play an important role in fostering the energy transition; however, they should be implemented as part of a policy portfolio, in combination with other policy instruments.", "authors": [{"name": "Martin Kumar Patel", "ids": ["26709558"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Jean-S\u00e9bastien  Broc", "ids": ["91592247"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Haein  Cho", "ids": ["3650332"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Daniel  Cabrera", "ids": ["2064554914"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Armin  Eberle", "ids": ["122919458"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Alessandro  Federici", "ids": ["98393343"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Alisa  Freyre", "ids": ["1506855171"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "C\u00e9dric  Jeanneret", "ids": ["2991646"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Kapil  Narula", "ids": ["16270706"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Vlasios  Oikonomou", "ids": ["2087517116"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Selin  Yilmaz", "ids": ["8098425"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["e741c9ba13783d06db8e262e56f5c2c7efa17dbf"], "outCitations": ["a77219c6ade7633383f06126da60a55bb6a38db9", "c02560ba88cd0d86e28cc2a1166ac0a6ff46af88", "1bfbcdb54be59f66e8d2204a6de856093f2d1234", "76b616563e66c6bfd5fb8b7153142c11ae994a92", "1e89d24cff81557f8b0ca526c98cb4bc6aaa97be", "051ce2a520959dfcdb0e73ea13a7d9214bde65cf", "8cadb276dfa23ead1cb8975fc4349293d5747ced", "9df07fed00851e9810f760791a93c48dbea5a3bc", "7b81ea51f0ae755ec24bd8e60c6364b4a2142d35", "4b8a19f4aa9dd82e73798bf1696d350374b4f672", "5e3700c423c244bfffe12fdb3bf80c6bb5f2d16a", "6e24502b9d1750df89a67ec1320467e22f7c4c3c", "23dc9e614ee6d84b7f25074d6fcc1e50cbea3f1d", "b45db90c60c0f2ead230dc2f76869c60c661834b", "6799bb87ea3edc7af7724ba5d4d61fa8c497d879", "e4f34de101aaba888931cec275e4420263aec11d", "48a0eba4bb1df2c391844aae409873942275ba09", "ade50f7750b66af66408d7f98ba363dc50bf8265", "8f9625635f62adb5917016786f87dc5436393253", "12c8b956e95cc92d7fa99d9b6151c44de3b41983", "84f3e73fea3a6f9cf6fdafd88ea047ccbd21675d", "2990b5c8c97a5d44373c7b326d40cf08163e0c25", "1fa4226847b45062d17c3ba88d33d1eaee9738a8", "f0f9c9cb6fcf7ffc3620d78d8c93fbff2eb6da1f", "8a9603b9d22063e661208cab7df06e814428a0d9", "edfe418c6a69c91217132f6035c5faeb004fd8dd", "0d5d80bfdda7451500755d112e2679cf16156470", "d0597e01033ef992211d5f5ed54fff1ab610caaf", "2cc6d96307fdde57df261fe705607e6a63f26ba5", "797a33c61c0b144377d7889cd8b514cbbbc01b70", "bad3f5739dc9cb70baed744b232b01d0aaa3f88b", "d9144fbc71e4faa29e957f45271efa24d21a2140", "69338431407c8418a59c92e939e9dad26b4ce13d", "059c1a15fe89a88f9a24d8727bfd063d183881b1", "b467cc3a4297029be6442140f7cff52ae1b0dfde", "88564b82229fdf09825a56540a9f6d5773665fd6", "6f929e2cf62de6a76985d96c066afbf559739ed8", "5d689717989690918d76b4804eb4b4e938112564", "5158d7e4c57e9979ed81c4c8c5940bd7d07dd568", "f16cbb92e751a75c09551210e88498e85bed71f0", "5e823fb4b2bd6d9c184ee781205e824e8c4512a6", "a7fe369cbd7ed0500670d403dc0adbc80c6fb6ec", "38d1d0885cef006095ccab5660da1acdf7672ac4", "4291705f600697cf55dad61f07f0454dd5cf9f9d", "7b6bb58e74ad5ebee52613cd409d0c52887c248f", "ac280be0861f1a43a3ce1055d00ef6d0343f15f7", "cf93df6bd4f7683bbb2c4d8ab6d5c1d16a0c759e", "0627f77370551e5f383f244222d41ee9e1a02631", "e668699edc3a89333edbee0275106a763d1515e6", "6fd237a744bfe0eca05e1c34f87959e0062d131c", "321aa7889c394f940fa47ba1aa96b543eec3f4a9", "0d3b114a6c7042a3db8324a4daab10e6ff9389e4", "9d50c235ecdb471d78e47af642b83a9b77b88c46", "7174f92511fab94ed7d24dac9db97e1d2a3dfd51", "67299e2a9d4f52fd8ee5e4d42bcefb56bd97d706"], "year": 2021, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7f21d9645b7f0aa1afc8c0c80c09f493474a6f0a", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://srv-clst-301-data66.zhaw.ch/bitstream/11475/22177/2/2021_Patel-etal_Energy-efficiency-programmes_Energies.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Energies", "journalVolume": "14", "journalPages": "1742", "doi": "10.3390/EN14061742", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.3390/EN14061742", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3137205013", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

This was done to a sample of German listed firms which diverge from the US market in accounting standards, market maturity and corporate governance culture (bank-based in contrast to the market-based US regime) as well as different market movements and trends which influence main input factors and estimations (e.g. market risk premium, inflation rate and GDP growth rate). To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper to address this issue for a sample of listed firms from the largest bank-based European economy.Using different accuracy measures such as absolute prediction error (average, median and central tendency) as well as multiple regression analysis the results show that dividend discount and abnormal earnings models ten to provide better accuracy than the free cash flow approach. Additionally, we find evidence of the importance in German accounting standards in the less accurate performance of the abnormal earnings model compared to previous studies due to the conservative accounting and the influence of hidden reserves. Finally, we did not find any significant valuation differences regarding the alternative values used for growth and discount rates.", "authors": [{"name": "Christoph  Hukelmann", "ids": ["120597027"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Cesario  Mateus", "ids": ["46206050"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Irina  B.

More and more, the negotiation, implementation, and review of contracts are carried out with standardized procedures based on information technology. This not only creates new opportunities to organize business but also new opportunities for the legislator to regulate contracts. In addition to the direct determination of the rights and duties of the parties via contract law, he might now regulate the way contracts are managed. First examples of such regulations have already been adopted. The paper describes the advantages and disadvantages of such regulations. On the one hand, they might substitute mandatory contract rules and hence increase freedom of contract between the parties. On the other hand, they can increase the bureaucracy within firms and thus decrease the parties\u2019 freedom.", "authors": [{"name": "Lorenz  Kaehler", "ids": ["2077256161"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["021a0042d3cdaca535fc2b85d69f5604dc8cb761", "ee4241c4e37a342f0537d92ee99d9ca4a725a11e", "876329809c7af2a26e2b42dcf8e7654a290f458e", "7846100e999a3e5bc490fdc8cb627b08ef19a7bc", "6d595b852cd0abcb0c223dc7dd4454e2a35409b7", "5556ffc3a3c6079419e9ce3f86c52eac8d4e7732", "57391ee71d97b6b5ff457bef2243bfce9345ae7b", "f66109a6700d65e6c05d285b675687459aa14d6f", "b2ab33642a25c2893e7dea5fdafe38badb53b2fc", "9d741e93e8449cc494ec68de5fb967f65253d17f", "e49bec65bbf79c2766d7f49cfab9968d169665e8", "b65a176848d4e93a2cb9f02754cfd31d8859a4c4"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2013, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/48fd4ce2effcdae408bb685e64d12ff213b1d645", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4362&context=lcp"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Law and contemporary problems", "journalVolume": "76", "journalPages": "89-103", "doi": "10.2139/SSRN.2285689", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.2139/SSRN.2285689", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2163874898", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

In this paper, we consider the literature of the last 25 years which extends our understanding of allocations of ownership rights and the boundaries of the firm as responses to contractual incompleteness. From this perspective, ownership represents an allocation of control rights to those with the potential to make the most important (value-enhancing) relationship-specific investments. We provide an outline of this modern approach to contractual incompleteness, illustrate its application to a range of issues in public and private ownership, investment, governance and decision-making, and provide suggestions about the impact that this approach might have on the scope, structure and management of the public sector in the 21st century.", "authors": [{"name": "Lewis

We extend this model by allowing more than two regimes of default correlations. The model is calibrated to market spreads at times of financial distress and during calm periods.

In the present world, engineers and scientists are expected to invent new materials to solve the global problem of climate change. For the transport sector, the challenge for material engineers is to change the oil-based world into a sustainable world. After witnessing the recent high oil price and its adverse impact on the global economy, it is time to accelerate our efforts towards this change. Industries are tackling global energy issues such as oil and CO2, as well as local environmental problems, such as NOx and particulate matter. Hydrogen is the most promising candidate to provide carbon-free, emission-free and oil-free mobility. As such, engineers are working very hard to bring this technology into the real society. This paper describes recent progress of vehicle technologies, as well as hydrogen-storage technologies to extend the cruise range and ensure the easiness of refuelling and requesting material scientists to collaborate with industry to fight against global warming.", "authors": [{"name": "Katsuhiko  Hirose", "ids": ["145511854"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["515929757cf81f82a087b5f71e5321abfa1eca95", "07c932ab97bee5e9070dc55378290ef95e44cd99", "431ddbdda42ac69e77c64704255b5a9700f0ae3f", "cc856fda1f551cee97591db18db27f08f724a321", "76501377c11343f9b2cbd71c5262aabae0f9d727", "ddb7ed1b1ad72a11c85c1d5c2c8326c6a382a9f0", "37421c537772ac2a9b6a5edfad3e4c3b53a00727", "60c99ca05098bb25c24bf9139972473c402fb0ee", "3d3047853cae3a6e1f4765ac16050323883a8c13", "440c6b5099ec19ee7fc1afe5f5027544b1cb7b7c", "ff249fa64c1f7073dccaa9bcd8035fb40fda8e5c", "b4f10cb81d8917600faae6ac8e88e40a32d27b8f", "5023572a72cdfb5717bf73f2e9f6e8dfc30658bd", "072889253c2c5f78021ebedc39649394333c8707", "ed824acac14989065b2812e0e7fdbd2a6dc73287", "14949ba5205aa8273220643982d93bb10cbda134", "a4d5adba85c38c1c41775de999c6061f8c78014a", "720e4cbced3e0c746652423e55dcf00cf09031dd"], "outCitations": ["80e38b9dba9f0f611f438d4a642b1f2c5bec93b5", "3170770aaf8a2c0382cf3dcc0d1a01dc0ed07dcd", "b03dad483cbeecbd24c0278c73c7e12914e3e3ca", "f3bb6c58cf3752d012a88880f0e414fbb82ecf3c", "406f5a55f9f1462acdca1a82ffa14a5ef5bc2f98", "9b7701f7c6ba3955a189d004e203737b17dee10f", "2ffbdd198ab977e48da076af5351e37110ef24c6", "b99c066b1507d3498b515c2948535e9fec16f201", "da5ab42b9463abd22182b30ca9ecde60b81bb695", "06fe896b16527b187b34e1ded8fdc623257a1290", "e6a4418acfdd12e5bbc4da5e8a0b22f5cde32d1f", "ad80cc7ecedfda8a0965610ab133b732df02f017", "992ab6b29b6a82ada138b659f7e6c8c87686f87f", "af6aa30ca35a83e6010cda0b8b07625dbb074c37", "50a7c847a95305353c99af1f0552882a8ebb9258", "ece82ae755904cba0f7af7338d25481ed530a696", "33d8dc14b73d6e02e589ad349f7ed7466d38a40b"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d77eca2d04270b74137be2f36de23e7d007e2da7", "sources": ["Medline"], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences", "journalName": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences", "journalVolume": "368", "journalPages": "3365 - 3377", "doi": "10.1098/rsta.2010.0115", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2010.0115", "pmid": "20566516", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business", "Medicine"], "magId": "1994233239", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

With the arrival of the Internet, the business world has become digitalized, and people prefer to buy stuff online, which is easier and faster. Online advertising, otherwise known as e-advertising, gives a new dimension and unique charm to the product, which is an added advantage. The primary benefit of online advertising over traditional form of advertising is that it surpasses all geographical boundaries, which cannot be gained locally. This leads to great progress in business, which is the ultimate aim of any businessman. Online advertising offers a wide spectrum of recognition, which is incomparable to any other mode of advertising. Online advertising has no time limitations and can be viewed day and night throughout the globe.

The portfolio approach combines a strong focus on the city\u2019s key industry sectors with a \u2018quality-orientated\u2019 way of event strategy development and implementation. Rather than aiming at filling the event venues with a quantity of random business events, Manchester has successfully secured a number of large-scale conferences with a strong international profile that are aligned with the city\u2019s key industry sectors such as Biomedicine, Healthcare, Sport, IT and Social Science. The city also aims at creating its own business events to fill the gaps in the calendar and prioritise specific areas, Digital or Advanced Materials, for example. The chapter also analyses the nature of the inter-organisational collaboration and joint decision-making in Manchester in relation to the business event sector development and destination promotion. The overall realisation of the business event strategy is guided by Marketing Manchester (MM), a local DMO, and Manchester Convention Bureau (MCB), responsible for event bidding and collaboration with the local, national and international partners and clients. This chapter draws on primary research in the form of document analysis and interviews conducted by the authors with several industry experts, responsible for business event strategy development and destination marketing in Manchester.", "authors": [{"name": "Zuzana  Vokacova", "ids": ["7244424"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Vladimir  Antchak", "ids": ["119106569"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["2107dd08ddeac34083fa83c4b6ea9ed0d82321b7", "60f1f789451e218de1366f60806ccf75114bf9e5", "854c2f33945d85acad39831e20ea5d57a42f0cda", "d1a2d9708c1b93b8f5a354699468486cbb9c0726", "da2e904c5139084d2045bc09c703a057c0c4314c", "9fff50fa39f61919a0cbaf7f7cfa6e4261a2f110", "325cc4e72a8a02ba3f39356712fc476a89ecf531", "cfba2effaaca2c6da2493cf47b15ca268393c687", "1c2031ce7904c8c42ecaa0456a474bfc9f01626d", "b7c50a19c8cd3db7be582bb8cb4ef83ec85610eb"], "year": 2019, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2d88a448d9f94bf5493d2c1d0235897e7ef9d554", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "Event Portfolio Management", "journalName": "Event Portfolio Management", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.23912/978-1-911396-91-8-4183", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.23912/978-1-911396-91-8-4183", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3017332481", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Requirements and expectations of utilities and consumer organisations in the renewable electricity sector in Europe", "paperAbstract": "Creation of an internal market for renewable electricity will involve a political negotiation process, similar to previous EU greenhouse gas negotiations. The Energy Ministers in the EU have agreed on an overall target of 21.7% of electricity supply from Renewable Energy Sources (RES-E) and a distribution of targets over the individual Member States. The REBUS project aimed at providing insights in the effects of implementing targets for renewable electricity generation at EU Member State level and the impact of introducing burden sharing systems within the EU, such as a Tradable Green Certificate (TGC) system. Member States can participate in such burden sharing systems to reduce the costs of achieving targets for electricity from renewable sources (RES-E), compared to strictly national implementation measures. The project concentrated on the development of the REBUS model, which quantifies the impact of trade (in green certificates, quotas or targets) and the implementation of different rules to setting targets at individual Member State level. In addition, the project has paid special attention to the participation of stakeholders such as utilities, traders, and consumers of electricity. What is their opinion on the target setting, on the design of a trading system and its practical implementation and monitoring aspects? Utilities and consumer organisations in Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom have been asked to comment on these issues. This report is a result of a series of interviews with these stakeholders on their reaction to different burden sharing proposals, and on the socioeconomic and financial impacts they foresee. The utilities take a critical view of their position in the renewable energy market and possible future international trading scheme. The main conclusions from the interviews are: \u2022 Generally, target setting and burden sharing are regarded political questions, on which governments should decide. \u2022 Stakeholders emphasise that it is of vital importance that ambitious targets are supported by a reliable trading system. The role of governments in providing a good monitoring system is stressed; double counting should be avoided. \u2022 There is a general preference for an obligatory over a voluntary target system. Almost all interviewees prefer a fine above other sanctions for penalising non-compliance.", "authors": [{"name": "M. A. Uyterlinde", "ids": ["93745613"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "M. H.

It examines the direct and interactive effects of the type of performance indicators, the evaluation period and reward timing, based on a cognitive approach that combines elements from accounting, economics and psychology literature. It also evaluates the moderating effect of strategy, propensity to leave and environmental uncertainty in the relationship between these three elements of the incentive system and MTO. This study argues that to obtain broader understanding of the impact of the elements of the incentive system on MTO, not only the isolated effects of each of these three elements must be considered, but also the way they interact to produce their effects. MTO is reflected by a set of dimensions that indicate the time horizon between effort allocation and reward timing, within which managers seek to optimize financial incentives. The hypotheses regarding the direct effects of the three elements of the incentive system predict that the more these elements reflect long-term financial effects, whether through greater relative importance attributed to non-financial performance indicators, a longer evaluation period, or a longer time lag for receiving compensation, the longer the managers\u2019 time orientation will be. The hypotheses also predict three interactive effects between these elements of the managerial incentive system: the first suggests that the evaluation period affects the relationship between the relative importance of the performance measure and MTO; the second predicts that reward timing affects the relationship between the evaluation period and MTO; and the last one indicates that reward timing affects the relationship between the relative importance of the performance indicator, the evaluation period and MTO, in a threeway interaction. To evaluate these hypotheses, individual level data was collected in a survey. In order to analyze the data, Partial Least Squares estimates were used, as well as additional methods that explore the interactions predicted in this study. The results indicated that, contrary to the expectations generally found in accounting literature and to the hypothesis formulated in this study, greater relative importance attributed to nonfinancial performance indicators affected MTO negatively. These results also indicated that rather than having an isolated effect on MTO, the effects of the evaluation period and reward timing occur interactively, although this interactive effect did not occur in the way this study predicted. The study did not identify interactive effects between the relative importance of performance indicators and the evaluation period or between the three elements of the incentive system. Additionally, the results indicated that strategy moderates the effect on MTO produced both by the evaluation period and by reward timing. The two main implications of this research are as follows: on the one hand, the types of performance indicators can lead to invalid conclusions about their effects on MTO, and on the other hand, a longer time orientation can be obtained by a managerial incentive plan that simultaneously includes a longer evaluation period and a longer time lag for receiving compensation. In the conclusion of this study, these results are discussed, the limitations of this research are presented and opportunities for future research are suggested.", "authors": [{"name": "Andson Braga de Aguiar", "ids": ["71570327"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["5ab9dc89c6b4a789460f86e085ff84ae943d950a", "3533f68f880159b5889d02e75b31f99e237596e3", "c6821f71137fb1e966c9ea05625e618ad73d7cf6", "e106150acf99b01c977c208d9d9ff7ecf45a2e24", "3eded6480c795627c7816f2ad27fcc0b6ab2a1fd"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8f05ca87acca0368825af1e3e9de378174205327", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/12/12136/tde-11092009-093820/publico/Andson_Braga_Aguiar.pdf", "http://www.fucape.br/_public/producao_cientifica/6/Andson%20Braga%20de%20Aguiar.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.11606/T.12.2009.TDE-11092009-093820", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.11606/T.12.2009.TDE-11092009-093820", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "1528416409", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Earlier work has explored the use of multiple-criteria decision tools in siting electric power plants and waste disposal repositories, where technical, geologic, political, and socioeconomic criteria and standards operate at county and higher spatial scales. For these problems, appropriate consideration of environmental equity will be different than when operating at solely the county and census tract scale. The nuclear waste problem in particular takes on regional dimensions and raises vexing questions of intergenerational as well as intragenerational environmental equity when a decision process for repository siting is developed. In this chapter, these issues will be explored in the context of nuclear waste repository siting, for both high-level and low-level wastes, and potential population exposure to long-lived radioactive wastes. Four case studies in East Asia will be presented: Japan, South Korea, China, and Taiwan. Three equity principles are applied to the case studies: voluntary assumption of a harm or burden, risk avoidance and risk reduction, and benefit-burden concordance. None of the cases meet all of the principles, while only Japan meets two of them. Thus, governments in all of the cases have more work to do to establish equitable programs for nuclear waste repository siting.", "authors": [{"name": "Barry D.

The hotel sector is one of the tourism sub-sectors that have been identified as the key growth area for the service industry in Malaysia. Challenges for the hotel sector in Malaysia such as high labor turnover and the difficulty in retaining the hotel employees are the main research issues that formed the setting of this paper. This research is addressing this issue through filling in the gap of the research area by understanding and examining the motivational factors that would actually motivate the hotel employees to maintain their engagement with their employer. The specific objective of this paper is to identify if there is a significant relationship between intrinsic motivation and loyalty or not. This quantitative research was carried out among operational employees in star-rated hotels. In Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, as it is evidential that the hotel sector experiencing high turnover that increase the cost of the human resource management. Results of the paper suggested that responsibility and work itself are the two most important factors in motivating hotel employees and that employees are more likely to be committed and engaged with their employer when the organization is endowing bigger empowerment on responsibility, and the commitment and engagement also can come from good job design on the nature of work itself. Notably, intrinsic motivators such as advancement, recognition and career growth had significant influence in motivating employees to commit more with their organization through responsibility and work itself of intrinsic motivation factors while advancement, recognition and career growth do not warrant the significance of the influence. However, it should be emphasized that all of these components were still factors in enhancing general work motivation among the hotel employees.", "authors": [{"name": "Toh Pei Sung", "ids": ["101536756"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Awangku Hassanal Bahar Bin Pengiran Bagula", "ids": ["122539057"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Janie  Liew-tsonis", "ids": ["1422457984"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Charlie Albert Lasuin", "ids": ["2674217"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Juliana  Langgat", "ids": ["98535061"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2013, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2cd1e852167f65e8ffdf86b3abcad95432816db9", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "1031540302", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

This study reached the following research conclusions: (1) There is a high correlation between market capitalization type valuation methods, but low correlation between the return on asset type methods. Therefore, when valuating intangible assets, the objectives must be very clear and the valuation method must be chosen carefully. An appropriate method must be chosen from the perspective of suitability to prevent false estimation of the company\u2019s real value. (2) The four dimensions of financial assets and intellectual capitals (structural, human, and relationship capitals) are not individually related to the company\u2019s value creation, and they have mutual contribution, advancement, and growth.

This approach makes bordering regions more resilient to current and predictable threats, and is largely focused on the practical problem-solving of local needs. Regardless of the (non)material benefits the European cross-border perspective provides, the situation remains very different in the Azerbaijan-Georgia cross-border reality, where the traditional understanding of borders continues to prevail. A field inquiry has shown that territorial local communities have not had a homogenous attitude towards the borderline and their neighbors, and that local municipalities lack the power and credibility to deal with local challenges autonomously. Unlike the European CBC, this cross-border context does not include the elements of bottom-up cross-border planning and locally institutionalized forms of collaboration.", "authors": [{"name": "Tinatini  Dvalishvili", "ids": ["104214891"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["519e231f9bbf707b0fcf11d33987b221e9e54d25", "0cfa3316fd1befd4582e2d47f34f38e902c6d02e", "2ddc0cef613ab0195b18ce5cc909761e20623357", "dfa62a08e427cf9d6292c5059318aa67ac549540", "a9a178fa021ff28e43e48cd1008685c83ff17ad7", "d2d33e567e5198c991e06bb5f9950b1937f9597c", "a5fe412f2f65e3c7a3fbeeb25ccc36fd4510b23c", "c19dfeccc7adcd10fe1edb661c3427bca5bd2107", "955d17fc41a61ab6a18667b36d9cea26bb09217f", "9b75c03d58e994409ba1a0572a4ebb0d3d9a1664", "57ab19c427d1f34d459af8f63c385ea85e44a686", "52f5a8caedba6465075f6f1eb02e5a567eee4628", "6fca910690f97d0a740ee73726b88a6468cb817f", "d4a47d7c2a6dcb2c69d88c864567f68d361bcd9b", "4fb80e2c7440992df4ef6e42d9d78c54f0e9bd1d", "1aa1ea8f87365471889aadce0f34593e547fc28b", "2a2a2e692d2924a75effebada2d7fd027e8112be", "d7464899a83c0e8023571994cc8c9a1b2194439e", "d8969105cb67da03e41735f61f2715cee361e02f", "4952d1e783f3a992b4a2857340b5937afe54af05", "1301b6f77a8cba107e0e051bc2bc8d93167bbcd4", "8417a89df427ea1434c8a54afc7265a23a3187aa", "497d76530f4b3a95813ce72388a38ff465b00261", "c7c769d3272be369f6337dbd11928b7b9e843047", "29785b8bd62cb6c37bce23d37786e5b5934b4b10", "45afa04b6f476583cb607f7385e7bb973c92a15d", "647d24c26cb9cf023af66dee35eaaccbd1686a1a", "3c2fb2c8a96a4a15a514f6df5695e822f2965403", "73aec524bfceacab9e84e1f031b1616e13bb8123", "b26b39d39b4951a255fb6f7328c5a0ad7325d2a8", "cedb5953a21735ce233dec506af31595f3b5a68c", "4f15c87c5096f1c22ebf3343d4ea5d567de26c35"], "year": 2020, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e746779eecb981cdd354bd6cab0f99829bd62a82", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/ssp/article/download/24916/22934"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "147-164", "doi": "10.14746/ssp.2020.3.8", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.14746/ssp.2020.3.8", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3107294400", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

{"id": "ca001bf3fc1bd836ac86918d4e7443bb22aa8769", "title": "Organizational changes in the activity of enterprises in the context of urgent crisis management", "paperAbstract": "Eliminating or reducing the negative impact of crisis phenomena on the economic condition of an enterprise and ensuring its further effective development is closely related to the concept of organizational changes. On the one hand, urgent crisis management tools almost always cause such changes. On the other hand, crisis phenomena in the activities of a business entity lead to the need to introduce organizational changes. In this context, it is noted that it is important to diagnose such changes even before their practical implementation begins. This problem is especially relevant when it is necessary to introduce so-called large-scale changes in the context of crisis management. Any mistakes at the beginning most likely will lead to failure to achieve the set goals and to problems in the practical implementation of these changes. Consequently, based on the results of the conducted research, organizational changes in the activities of enterprises in the conditions of crisis management at the beginning are proposed to be diagnosed taking into account four areas that correspond to the PAEI-model of Adizes, well known in the theory and practice. At the same time, it provides for determining the market orientation of organizational changes (proactive nature of organizational changes); the social orientation of organizational changes (integrative nature of organizational changes); the impact of organizational changes on the enterprise administration system (complementary nature of organizational changes); the impact of organizational changes on the operating environment of the enterprise (functional nature of organizational changes). The article offers a method for diagnosing organizational changes in the activities of enterprises in the conditions of crisis management, based on the method of hierarchy analysis (Analytic Hierarchy Process \u2013 AHP) and provides for the implementation of such key stages: the formation of an expert group; determining the level of a hierarchical model for diagnosing organizational changes in the conditions of anti-crisis management; studying the essence and characteristics of the proposed organizational changes, so that then diagnose them taking into account the directions of proactive, integrative, functional and complementary nature, using matrices of pairwise comparisons; determining eigenvectors, as well as establishing their normalized values, applying the known geometric mean of the matrix lines; determining the consistency of expert opinions; forming conclusions and recommendations.

For the mining areas of the Arctic Zone\u2014unlike other regions located in areas with a more favorable climate\u2014the injury rates are influenced not only by the underground labor conditions, but also by the adverse environmental factors.

The Supreme Court has never decided whether the Clauses apply to corporations. The Second Circuit is the only federal circuit to address the issue explicitly, holding in Consolidated Edison Co. of New York v. Pataki that Article I, Section 10\u2019s Bill of Attainder Clause applies to corporations. Other circuits either have not faced the issue or have assumed, for the purposes of the specific cases before them and without officially deciding, that the Clauses apply to corporations. The Second Circuit\u2019s reasoning fails as a foundation upon which courts can rely in administering future corporate attainder challenges\u2014drawing dubious inferences from inapplicable Supreme Court precedent and performing a partial merits analysis under the guise of deciding this threshold issue. This Note offers the first extended argument that the Bill of Attainder Clauses apply to corporations. While the Clauses\u2019 text is silent on the issue, this Note considers the history and precedent of the Bill of Attainder Clauses before exploring the Court\u2019s approach to corporate constitutional rights more generally. Assessing the theories of corporate personhood undergirding the Court\u2019s corporate constitutional rights cases and the purposes for which the attainder prohibition was adopted, this Note concludes that the Bill of Attainder Clauses, properly understood, apply to corporations.

First, older workers engaged in codifiable, routine tasks are particularly prone to the risk of being displaced by computers and robots. Second, several countries have in place various labour market institutions that encourage early retirement, such as exceptional entitlements or looser criteria for unemployment and disability benefits applied to older individuals. This paper presents evidence that these two factors reinforce each other to push older workers out of employment. It is found that older workers who are more exposed to digital technologies are more likely to leave employment, and that this effect is significantly magnified when they are eligible to an extension of unemployment benefits until they start drawing old age pension. Furthermore, a simple simulation based on the empirical findings illustrates that a reform that tightens the eligibility for the benefit extension would increase mostly the employment of older workers that are more exposed to digital technologies.", "authors": [{"name": "Naomitsu  Yashiro", "ids": ["117546770"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Tomi  Kyyr\u00e4", "ids": ["51216072"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Hyunjeong  Hwang", "ids": ["120422232"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Juha  Tuomala", "ids": ["119073784"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2020, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1c4d50c872c399509920a8ab2ed627a892dacce9", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "Research Papers in Economics", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.1787/3EA0C49B-EN", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1787/3EA0C49B-EN", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3114099689", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Historically, insolvency courts have adhered to the principle of \u201cterritoriality,\u201d which posits that bankruptcy proceedings should be brought in the jurisdiction where property or assets of the debtor are located, and that the courts in that forum have jurisdiction and priority over those assets. Based on this principle, in a typical domestic insolvency proceeding, one forum will exercise jurisdiction over the debtor and all of its assets; the adjudicator can thus make decisions that will bind all of the creditors seeking a piece of those assets. The principle of territoriality has become difficult to apply in our increasingly globalized world. Today\u2019s multinational corporations operate in multiple countries and hold assets across the globe. Thus a debtor and its affiliate entities may be subject to multiple insolvency proceedings in various jurisdictions. The efficiency gains of a single-forum insolvency process no longer exist, and instead debtors can find themselves in intractable disputes or subject to inconsistent decisions issued by multiple courts. Over the last two decades, there have been various proposals to address the complications inherent in cross-border insolvency proceedings. In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, which brought a wake of insolvent debtors with massive international presence, the issue has received increased attention. This paper Recently explores several ways in which international arbitration can be used to bring efficiency and consistency to cross-border insolvency proceedings.", "authors": [{"name": "Edna  Sussman", "ids": ["39559563"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Jennifer  Permesly", "ids": ["122003789"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["5a3bbfe77054b3ed81d5c7f8075fb3df436be05d", "500a43837458842339dcb8bf778e6cd89fca3c19"], "outCitations": ["464f6be52b4a3688e7a53bb1d0aa708ca42b8df9"], "year": 2013, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/14e3c450de66f43dd9213b276a6428de08ac1344", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://sussmanadr.com/docs/Bankruptcy%20and%20arbitration%20Fordham%20final%20as%20published%202013.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Bankruptcy", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.1163/9789004260207_011", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004260207_011", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "1739487006", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Despite the increasing significance of the GSCM approach at the global level, there is a paucity of empirical research that explores GSCM within the New Zealand business context. This study intends to bridge the gap in the literature by investigating the GSCM practices adopted by New Zealand based companies. To this end, a sample of 23 companies was selected and 29 interviews were conducted with senior corporate managers. The results revealed that most interviewees\u2019 companies were proactive in improving their mid-stream GSCM performance, but the same enthusiasm was not manifested at the upstream and downstream supply chain levels. Hence, we argue that companies need to recognise and embrace the holistic nature of GSCM and promote collaborative supply chain activities to realise improvements in environmental, economic and operational performance.", "authors": [{"name": "Aymen  Sajjad", "ids": ["101377884"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Gabriel  Eweje", "ids": ["17870346"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "David  Tappin", "ids": ["35467238"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["4fa3d047ce521a5fb9828d012a5cee7275c2d3ea", "9f6a17742a26c73ad49ceb4adba4cdb5bc8fa81d", "f182f231daa3e64d5caa1240aea3389dca3785e6"], "outCitations": ["83b7e40c68481c29234d29145565031f698820f6", "b780dee3894932e2d2de52cea48609940f60b4cd", "b86c6dcc9b6a211dc7cfacb102ff8cd61a11dab9", "11ff5e25cc0eef84fe5a4c41db82c53b836a215e", "032dab91e45bfb69665800717e911019f362ba74", "6bd05202f94c4279ba2fbce71299b6adc5135a24", "54f1811eaade276fc2b5eb531d7c2d60d8d33017", "29dfd3f9f747f02aa1336148b1c19f521d9caaa9", "1c8d577208d570681c7351f0948a805aadde65cd", "5c861d36303e1b5b9302b61ad437b03359ef79c4", "43827290d4f68f7fa55511375eb74802231b7961", "666757941651cd0e7481de5b2a0506c77f773364", "13bb6a971612d4a2a4385a4d6a45626c30523b2b", "0a649f841e000b45fbdb5ade06b04d7872a6af24", "1976b805d6844c976f435caa3b5f395f41004901", "47b0b5da8ee606c4f25e7694bbe1cb5bb234ac5a", "5fd91d42c57e11c6a87f17d61291146e87c239d3", "dfacd78641097a219c0d95d733ba942a00a7288e", "da7e4af739822d158ea7d731d6bd2a76689d9eca", "c1e22ed786bda9d43a974ca76bb6afabdbcf2c05", "8d375c7e8609495c9e1553343f611d69f4569906", "31d55aab3b97090fafa71c2e87ef5672570e5f55", "e02d35e8810eb6b4857def64910cc14ed94b243c", "e506df3dfcbff7f15020fbe9392e5182537e6eea", "2b1a99ef6b96d45ebeb8ae08b7dae3f00a2cbfe4", "5356117c2ba0164c391806546c75b1e16d7bfd17", "5f5678e40a115ad7210c010636e967a8e9aff50d", "c845403d5360e4fd6e8c49ac61c01a965bf27e3e", "df0524bc6c4b807119add1bc6b4366416373e287", "8328f2a493fad11875f452125a35edf4917bf9a3", "108f30a64b5a2233fc2fab1d29b8b5dde9a9c146", "96ea570b41a7e6d00ccb9ac3f2e9c311582aeed6", "72cbf0f5d0c9cea40edeb81d193b815403319bd1", "05f13f6f6e65ebca09048a30f2248b8d2f5c3bea", "c807756f35510fbc3ae4d7bdc50bb03d462e9c49", "3b6ae025a6c3725590f612dde071ddfbfcaae20f", "475537208b252a977abaef4631a7733112cce9de", "c5f16207e462e04e45c2d80aabdc96977c01dd7f", "96dedc663569321155102e87b8c6b1f26644356a", "7460b5353b2417109bbe32cac9625bc95e637983", "0a378ac2c2d8a8a3ad7cf446376b66e9ebaa9c90", "4480da2e587785f7fc06107bdb3122d3b1676b30", "f7483bc2281e732e7357f3b5ea176cdc44a012f2", "f30dd5a6b013fb36008a4bb44bc741e021195b1d", "6406f5a79f54ebef2119c1217ad49dd0b2beb2b9", "7bdf2e430766a058ea351b0f463790997ab91908", "195b0daa812cbd881c4d7bba6e1be4be13f8470b", "13849e0bc9a30445d44524e0eca462ca87ddcf97", "6b6dd928bb0a3ed55fc0a0b4dea4919f96fab0da", "e22a0fd8b651da459f6abeffff8c98fd3f5849c9", "e6b3dda8bc02b3b2eebbb469901614ba89efc7fb", "c2ceec750cc24533d629ec0046f9e7a210055980", "d8153614fd6a93185b645615b4d49a1f426fe770", "ea0e4ec9aff3c849dcf1c9e35f62c3f7246d2496", "043c1b454f98df6a9aed9e7ad319b4e53ca18e8f", "91a656e40a2e33935a0ab7e8a311718076569e2b", "9cd6b77f047285be8efcd2ef9b4a3a9c3280c097", "90bd15f05a83a521a48b39df7510ed5acc65444e", "9d76cc28be2b4e26e6eac68cfa676045c91ff93a", "ad64c7c3bb14932ae9b00442d099d962ecd29b7f", "94c23cb4f09c639b24a1593d83a39ba6184f3bc7", "15b617086a762b1fba20c84b59f9dd01b5632c83", "9969190f6849ddacec96c16188b2b9c708b6fdcf", "ca71c573ab3d8e77b8ce8bd5eb211f5eaf1234aa", "4243ddaed83f4f1f4a6fa965c0dcb61eb4c5ef77", "e08eb2332a1b8b4af97c91387267534dc4123428", "5a8d3314daf7cd7355f3d5279a45654835329dc2", "22307e44871a4e31e1a43fe2448cc1f92446a990", "e5136e9306bf1b0e3d4be0cea384ee9a969a44fa", "d2091e4aa4769a48035e45c99431932823adb361", "95f48af34cc49c4b19f1770130217e833e01021c", "c4067a4b265ca0acc5918b303d615627c21f56a1", "f0e05e1d396cec9a665aa4915a3415cdf26a2386", "5d8c314feec1c332d206c0d7e5dbb1ef82150a20", "aa36bb67d889dce77dc4a494da5af603dfb57c97"], "year": 2019, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6899f3ccc5291a28af65e57177b33e71f605f49e", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "Australasian Journal of Environmental Management", "journalName": "Australasian Journal of Environmental Management", "journalVolume": "27", "journalPages": "42 - 62", "doi": "10.1080/14486563.2019.1683769", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1080/14486563.2019.1683769", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2985238214", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

The Effectiveness of Laws Governing Data Breaches in Australia", "paperAbstract": "The increasing prevalence of large-scale data breaches prompted Australia to strengthen the Privacy Act by enacting the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act to regulate the behaviour of entities entrusted with personal data. However, this paper argues that these legislative instruments are ineffective when dealing with data breaches and their associated problems. In supporting this conclusion, this paper first develops a criterion for effective data breach law, and then evaluates the Australian framework against this criterion to determine its operational effectiveness. In addition, this paper analyses practical developments in the area of data-breach law to garner insights as to how the Australian framework can be made more effective. Ultimately, this paper concludes that the Australian framework is ineffective when dealing with large-scale data breaches, and recommends future legislative amendment as a means of bolstering its effectiveness.", "authors": [{"name": "Jack  Hile", "ids": ["2129333652"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["4afdd1d5756ba8aea660c07d9d640bb63ecc8a87", "dd6adc90a5248438e92ac829fc6e316bf242e050"], "outCitations": ["7064aa2a68f49a655ca45c048fcaedcb3ff7c69b", "48ddcc37578749f322892cd79a57a40db7dd52f6", "4d2783d874790b4831ebfd5a8b308ff9ab83fb94", "97e9dae10c1444b6d5be9c43bcfc6dc8b27d9e38", "535d31413013a851e9fc918c46affc8d01e4f9e9", "957c25106beafdc5e60dba7b17d2422ae2ce51d9", "3689b03d70cdb242f1d6343351aae8539866e113", "d8e9ab89bdda258da72aca96c1376962aefc2157", "a1576dc3d201fa0abd888f8e863d3bb2b7772881", "ecc96a3065f701da3d77643be844fd2ee6bda746", "619e11158530b3e5f4560c5eee8ac985fd0e40a9", "52303c612f6175c84d6dcfc933e8fb5f2383fe39", "dc1046bd98425642b1f7471223c92e122898dcc1", "23bedfba969846716985d2f24f747198ac716128", "99bbb12faddc0d1b23608175e7201deb88825671", "fa6c0e1ffa5ea32b830271ce619b18903c3ccd4b", "f3b450c090a18019c0055950c5062e9f41b1de3b", "dbc4f3fa057b2c2f96873d926658edfcce3897d2", "fb7846f6d4a671a15ebb5cae1b314403799f42eb", "141543b7190b7a9cde8965078c21a65b84060005", "4b4a1cd7c58eb8c78195bbedbc632c5554802f07", "0ed0d3a650c0b6cecea6361e50eb58632a0f7902", "0cdbb4e049cbb3002343493f1504706372281c6d", "337282cbe925eb8a88b18e587b3352e37eebd71f", "9d8fbe12cee6c47ae68546fbd38937cecc686582", "3faee3afe0a29bfbbb154416508d0cf3d4d620e8", "7408b5665b7305a1ecfa92abc0d2c1a72953b837", "637418982838a88ca14463daf98761e4d694d8ce", "591c6ab3b7991e608d532382e35d13f262286ea3", "a3016f280354e4b8c8381f7e86b001d2ba8fa4df", "faf8e4338efd1141b9bc25c8014c08bede76e2fa", "25848d690c8e319c433e2c8226cebdf725121419", "8a82f71ede289362fc624a0af9042e5a4551afc1", "cd044b958b386afd3d8351e54d0b987ffca992d0", "5acecd1bdbff09a14ddd89004882b1258302f5aa", "bb2d22a8276c3520bb78436a6fc028bb022e0200", "01d816c0ea7fde0d167d917ddf7e449813cb41c1"], "year": 2021, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ed1828ac9619912554927489a17333675c240d5e", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "Journal of Telecommunications and the Digital Economy", "journalName": "Journal of Telecommunications and the Digital Economy", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.18080/jtde.v9n2.381", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.18080/jtde.v9n2.381", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3174703873", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

First, he acts as an agent of the carrier or of the shipper. Second, he acts as a the carrier by entering contract of carriage of goods with the shipper or by issuing bill of lading. Third, he plays as an intermediary between the carrier and the shipper, which falls within the pure definition of the freight forwarder in the Korean Commercial Code. This article focus on the legal issue on the freight forwarder as the carrier and as the intermediary. Korean Commercial Code does not require any status for being a carrier. Even a pure freight forwarder is entitled to become a carrier. As a result, the freight forwarder try to become a contracting carrier with the shipper. A freight forwarder as a contracting carrier enter into the contract of carriage with the ocean carrier with the means of sea transportation. A shipper may not fully compensated from the freight forwarder as the carrier(defendant) because he does not possess the ship itself. On the other hand, the freight forwarder as the carrier is entitled to limit its liability according to Commercial Code like any other general carrier. Therefore, there is necessity for the shipper to be protected under Korean law. When the freight forwarder acts as an intermediary, he may be liable for the breach of the duty. Even though he is fully liable for the damages against the shipper, he can not indemnify the paid amount fully when he makes a recourse claim to the carrier because the carrier is entitled to limit its liability pursuant to Korean Commercial Code. To strike the balance between the carrier and intermediary, the writer emphasizes that the limitation scheme should be adopted in the Commercial Code for protecting the freight forwarder as the intermediary.", "authors": [{"name": "\uae08\uc778\ud604", "ids": ["121207476"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f1c53e81773ff7aa94cbd78dfebb9258a30b39f4", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2908554624", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Purposive sampling method was adopted to choose sample firms from those listed in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Of the 4573 firms listed in BSE, banking, insurance and financial firms were excluded as they are governed by different bodies. Foreign firms and companies acquired during the period of investigation were also excluded. So a sample of 771 firms during the period 2001 to 2005 was studied. The data were analyzed using 't' test to find the difference in the firm value between promoter family controlled and non- promoter family controlled firms. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors that affect firm value. This study found that the firm value is not significantly affected by the ownership type of the firm.", "authors": [{"name": "Palanisamy  Saravanan", "ids": ["145528303"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["67c973678a50be25335e218c3873dbdc7a7fe289", "6ccee5ee32f55bc7ce2a92348113bf16ac85b7b2", "0ceb5d3a1276f715f4a3b82a6cb3e1e23934de20", "5b574db46ae7f733f459fd4bb66475962f20adb7", "1dfb82f04eb8783dd1ef94238da2027d12f091e7", "02920caf3788480afed2d8a14da4938144dfe928", "0e6d382806760ebe01e3fff98e165f3a03d571ee"], "outCitations": ["0bbd92e2b05d0a032a556bcfb3ad49cd9aa185fb", "3bffa2c41cf888df6a030fcd8dcc250232ef0bb1", "dbea01210474a3cc9796a0b91587c31908d4b9e9", "813108b1a2462b202315bf580b1557127d384402", "8d5108100a27defc2e2bd132d192d7ebcc7f1a3d", "c1c1b26845d6eba0d1ce71c3bc62651d3539ef26", "7558c6ddbeb3b090cce4f6d36fa725cc62ce8798", "2fdb796e9f9581c7aa2dd4617bb6ded7e5fa8cee", "e83913d914c48fa023246a8b264ffd348cc0571f", "6813131ea7e58b473546cdf6ad7213a4f87ccef2", "b444fafa4e0fa16eb26d232c75340b2f2b07f2a1", "470ba5fe045b7004499965d0f4835911ce6809fc", "5c39023ae6be1a96be87d11a2ccd3b13f365a0fb", "99cb634399f61eec34aae13fcd7f6fe2c5f94d6c", "a7fec4157d09363780012968e63124fe4dfcf028", "fe5359389bc8df0ee3f5ed92fd27d63a55b91ddc", "ec6449b8d13a38b559ef5a641ebb9b7fee8ac60c", "2ec70dc90d7171c8761e85654d12d26826586607", "6f95a04f4729df4cffa9087f6b110cb36efd4866", "de18d2f500f1b7a00f69ff6f1b4d02629cab0ed7", "f0679e3cb66b6e380435a7319f91247375dcbbb4", "9a899eefacf54a5dc3cf4a8688d1eef8e89c6714", "e1c2b8844ad0c84c5e7c74929466eb98e1769dd7", "7fd768e50fab51edc8d1c48e89d7846c2cacd063", "5ce762cf9632e11ff3e2f9decfbaccaf68f9115f", "4bff70f2ddc7490437e8812557db2f983c08f81d", "840c8e1621d083cffd5fd5f31364d21d3260b894", "ae48c66d5e86722277c507f00f61256836b0ecee", "e73eb6d29c2f6df077e0407d9dd9c60da236ee86", "ba4dddd4046090f917e683499f77fd3d6f724c11", "739c7b3de38c629815a89522feeaa28fb8bed6ce", "474de7940cba3ee6890df613422b56fbd0d947aa", "0d2881c7b6f9fc0ac53b288a63146ba42cd8063e", "5c6e189928ba88fe1650a09de4558149ae21558f", "f0fa91ae69a383e11299dc946a6b46fb16540145", "77b011e35ff2e39d5849bfa3018074990628af86", "d703978d319ae172b45373d9d419ffa11edc4e38", "5bf2932176e26c32cfdb4ec3ceb53ca9139d43e0", "355e5b6065880d2e43ac9e131d571ebda939299f", "1d9d8b06704422233586b74be406cdb57572d966", "689bfcf6ce9fc9f212de67c2514e1ac6d2ec3c08", "a80878efb3d8b9e7a6f9acaa523e4ca5b08110a7", "d705de41c5f867dc6c7f8c1a246dc688706f9da3", "06d31f933d5c89ebc496ec49fa8e29384308bf91", "f0eacb52317ae9407c33e986dc7db8dea9476b10", "8af97c61038766c2a8f85426ad3d0c1fff181b34", "5244cf045e6bb7fc63b1fbb1e67a9f68de14db1d", "ffb833fab60a3c760ea2a5338bbdd728d956fb05", "c77bd2d0933794ee5e4ad9e6335ec9e495c6d51c"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/63c22309843086f034536803e2b2ff1c3c78a8a9", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://www.greatlakes.edu.in/pdf/gl_3954.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Emerging Markets: Finance eJournal", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.1360534", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1360534", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2128940278", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Advertising has become a second-level discipline under the discipline of journalism and communication through the integration of academics and practice. At present, according to the professional attributes of colleges and universities, there are different logical division standards for advertising majors. From the content point of view, it can be divided into four categories: advertising practice, advertising theory, advertising history and advertising criticism. However, in the actual teaching process, there is still a great disagreement between the advertising academia and the advertising industry on advertising, which has always threatened a potential and necessary tension. In general, the common recognition of advertising disciplines by all sectors of society is an applied discipline. Therefore, how to train students to improve their innovative ability in practice and serve the society in advertising teaching requires advertising teachers to break the routine in advertising teaching, carry out role transformation, strive to connect advertising theory and explore the basis of education science in the new era with innovative practice.", "authors": [{"name": "Zhi  Li", "ids": ["2118213859"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Yuemeng  Ge", "ids": ["121580750"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2019, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8c95460a9c21e069e0ac67af7c8bc5e34ce37262", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://download.atlantis-press.com/article/125925562.pdf"], "venue": "Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Education Reform and Social Sciences (ERSS 2019)", "journalName": "Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Education Reform and Social Sciences (ERSS 2019)", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.2991/assehr.k.191206.062", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.2991/assehr.k.191206.062", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3000493634", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Given that the city state has been recognised as one of the most open economies in the world, this study attempts to explore the causality relationships between tourism, openness to merchandise and services trade. Firstly, the study shows bi-direction causality between international visitor arrivals to Singapore and openness to merchandise trade. Secondly, there is a unidirectional causality from openness to services trade to international visitor arrivals to Singapore. The findings imply that further trade liberalisation in goods as well as services sectors can be seen as an important catalyst for the growth, and development of the tourism sector. Conversely, an increase in tourism activities could also encourage the host country to open itself to more international trade. Furthermore, it is imperative to liberalise the services sector in Singapore in order facilitate more openness in merchandise trade given a large scale of services constitutes goods trade.", "authors": [{"name": "Koi Nyen Wong", "ids": ["145489553"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Tuck Cheong Tang", "ids": ["40898294"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["4f7bdda0a5a0068563c74da32511453d9e29cffb", "59a9eebe54585a9fa0366e96fe9892bb6148cee9", "fd118c5939e5527d735bf9f4c21e3785a3745353", "e2719f437589c16891c89d3595dd95b685739f1d", "f97ba43adfd5f6a6641c879b854149c4a7df7ca4", "7ea670d58571d74fa65c4a50745c4c57f5d4254b", "a5f61cdff76e2a5a14df8ce273aaa6c229f3204f", "0fdd0a09e298cc876bd5d622d136a17c2bacf93c", "2e34ca532e2f68dacce496efbc8fa52bd13f6238", "9bdea36766e3cdcfaa2e3c9ecd1a4bb328bc5898", "deb56d6418854c4fd27ea5ee79cd63b6c5444da1", "80f6144df724dca0caacbfeafed13692554d0986", "bd3a6b06537db6e66aaa2e345ab3af7f307640ad", "53f281db438dd269f00ee75054d61de2c2bb6182", "c9e07dddcdee9f7d21be0d2b6c5ee7f23b409e59", "a086d52490e325901a13c5a2980ee05e8b0468a9", "78444be1d65238f46b8116334f2977b3a2082643", "cec7b0b6d56395383565f8c64317e7e76b30d0c9"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9ef593ffba446786eb2aab267c4cca467184495a", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.monash.edu/business/economics/research/publications/2008/2608tourismwongtang.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "1528197580", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Education is very strategic aspect and is very influencial to human and also the nation's productivity. However, in Indonesia education service implementation is still very complex, with clear disparity in educational service, showing that there has been inequality in educational service handling. Therefore the government implements minimum educational service standard of basic education. This research was aimed at evaluating the fulfillment of the Minimum Service Standard (MSS) for Basic Education in Demak Regency, which in fact a coastal area with various physical and environmental problems.

Drawing on the work of Ahlin and Lin (2006), who find that numerous macroeconomic indicators affect MFI performance, this paper uses a demand-based model to study empirically how the broader business environment in a country affects MFI performance. Most of the results indicate that factors that are supportive of development generally are also supportive of microfinance activities. MFIs tend to perform better in terms of sustainability and outreach in countries that are business-friendly and have relatively developed credit markets. The quantitative impact of the business environment on MFI performance is also substantial, although most of the variation in MFI performance appears to be due to differences at the institution level.", "authors": [{"name": "Michael  Maio", "ids": ["49603524"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["13d9757d606157b3e5650489b422b4f834836db5", "67ff5fc362f7e301e31a66c8e64793086cc40c91", "f9db587627ba80fc3d2b5135ba8d80f93b629079", "f44cc1e2cdac319a73f559e43a77a26b99b98c54", "0aad7683d33c8e4dd161b1ffd85ad0e8907c3188", "cb9d67f460864494d9975486bd8249941cb446a9", "7847011c0fd1a53e552c1e710a6e2012e915dd57", "da945e710e3a110e50360deacad1bf19a7299934", "f66d2564109f1df7a8a918e8af5ef127b64a0013", "5cbf980fbd8d2061a4705bc81789a245a3b7edd1", "9513778769bfee9f38acb4617caa5dbd5e466d43", "118d543e247f82a065d63a6c56461ed1946f2c09"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8dddf15031499321174b741df4010f2b6fc2347c", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://as.vanderbilt.edu/econ/documents/2008-honors-maio.pdf", "https://as.vanderbilt.edu/econ/documents/2008-honors-maio.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3049135946", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

To emphasize this evidence, we empirically analyzed the panel data of the period 2011-2013. We found that politically connected firms have a negative and significant impact on the cost of debt financing compared to Non- politically connected firms. The reducing of cost of debt in politically connected firms is a consequence based on shared resource knowledge of Political connection directors in law, finance and government procurement contracts for favorable government policies and tax rebates.

The present work intends to formalize a conceptual model by decomposing tourism nights, trips, and average duration of visit in a given destination, in terms of quantities and parameters that only for a small part could be derived from official tourism statistics. On the other hand, most of the quantities and parameters required for determining the number of tourists in a given destination are in general unknown, and need to be (directly or indirectly) estimated. Empirical evidences resulting from a survey on incoming tourism in Sicily are provided, showing the biases affecting supply-side statistics on tourism when they are used as a measure of tourism flows in a destination. The changing nature of demand and the increasing segmentation of the holyday market also raise the need for more accurate, destination-based, information, and the model proposed can assist destination managers and researchers in facing the problem of quantifying and analysing tourism behaviours.", "authors": [{"name": "Stefano De Cantis", "ids": ["3260865"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Mauro  Ferrante", "ids": ["35777604"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["c1e863b4dfea850951906d8384de7dfaf88948ef"], "outCitations": ["cce4a4977917bf7846049113f808a7edfaa18fbf", "9e01723823d890d1cead7ef2ef01ca73aeed982d", "c7a5442554bcb6193a233907052e79872004ca5d", "28c1f80d51054457fee41b36d840c64f5381c02e", "642075e2769f0bd953397d24afd0e86524cae899", "3380fdbaedb55c8871f1f97e1ebcd8e1fe11b0b7", "4bd16cb9b421dac96cab46c04348a330e1648b38", "6e84a16424c768c8a3f5dc680cab7de9e2b84c9d", "7fa72dcb1063c0c02f119b0dcd0c04d7b3ba89c9", "4b51afa5a02df3ef9e04b973e12cd1040a0aae62", "8df56439f613c7477972705a5b84f458714a7950", "ea0619f7454297e48848d5a51dd24977a6308239", "110de62bb39bed886484c6400124eb71965c2c5a"], "year": 2014, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ee549a37a479f46da0cb086ac93d1c9fbfc7de2b", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "371-381", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-05552-7_32", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-05552-7_32", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "158274470", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

This paper aims to empirically find whether small and large firms pursue DS strategy for similar reasons or for different one. By using 7 years\u2019 panel data of 419 non-financial companies, the comparative results confirm the existence of DS across organizations. Small companies follow it to reduce expected bankruptcy cost, for economizing information asymmetry, decreasing agency conflicts and due to limited ingress to the debt market. While large companies include few types of debt to reduce operational risk, flotation cost and for building good reputation. We suggest several theoretical justifications for these results.

Motivation and performance of the employees are essential tools for the success of any organization in the long run. On the one hand, measuring performance is critical to organization's management, as it highlights the evolution and achievement of the organization. On the other hand, there is a positive relationship between employee motivation and organizational effectiveness, reflected in numerous studies. This paper aims to analyze the drivers of employee motivation to high levels of organizational performance. The literature shows that factors such as empowerment and recognition increase employee motivation. If the empowerment and recognition of employees is increased, their motivation to work will also improve, as well as their accomplishments and the organizational performance. Nevertheless, employee dissatisfactions caused by monotonous jobs and pressure from clients, might weaken the organizational performance. Therefore, jobs absenteeism rates may increase and employees might leave the organization to joint competitors that offer better work conditions and higher incentives. Not all individuals are the same, so each one should be motivated using different strategies. For example, one employee may be motivated by higher commission, while another might be motivated by job satisfaction or a better work environment.", "authors": [{"name": "Ovidiu-Iliuta  Dobre",

RFID systems applications can be used by different industry sectors like the military, retail, industrial, life sciences, logistics, and financial. The military and the life sciences sectors have been the first in using this technology (Das et al, 2002; Harrop et al, 2003; IDTechEx Ltd, 2003a), although within a more expensive and sophisticated context than we may find in most consumer goods supply chains. Surveys of the application of RFID technology find it is being used mostly for industrial/manufacturing 44.5 percent of the RFID market (Perez, 2003) and transportation/distribution 30.3 percent of the RFID market (Perez, 2003).", "authors": [{"name": "Richard  Wilding", "ids": ["40585879"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Tiago  Delgardo", "ids": ["73590177"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["df22054ec0700ce1247c985ed4213488e9cbc6d7"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2004, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d2d844ec7609160d53b95061605ec3966d89f061", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1826/2764/RFID%20Demystified-Part%202-2004.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2779681559", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

The analysis concludes that foreign investment that is embedded in ethnic ties leads to greater linkages to local firms and more high-value activities being transferred to the investee nation.

Previous literature studied on the factors of impulse purchase in different advertising mediums like website, mobile, traditional retail store and traditional television. However, none of the impulse purchase model is dedicated towards influencing impulse purchase tendency for interactive TV advertising. Therefore, this study focuses on the awareness among potential advertising designer regarding iTV advertising. A series of interviews were conducted involving 58 potential advertising designers. The results from interview are presented in this paper, indicating that majority of the respondents indicate that, there is a difference between advertising with interaction and without interaction elements where the advertising with interactive interaction elements could perceived influence more consumers in their purchasing tendency compared to advertising without interaction elements.", "authors": [{"name": "Azizah Che Omar", "ids": ["2055749920"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["edac6e154950a4ab2eaa24416c89fd1a3d09ffb1", "08a34174afea61be63b9cdca427365c2f49e151e", "bc3cd911436176ef40aee3bdd2d933568e2fbf13", "943179854c65fae086e526d7fadf5cd2fd6f668d", "0a1badd00c383dc3573dfdbdb171321e9f520922", "49da5156e0eef3bc51d30a5157d89ad315550a06", "eeff626eeb46a657e1188a3f95863767a438bd62", "45babdbc207365de390d02f7c7a0ce8af4a90532"], "year": 2018, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6d388e304d7438be825a5aef41856507bef72f5e", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://ww.sciencepubco.com/index.php/ijet/article/download/25564/13003"], "venue": "", "journalName": "International journal of engineering and technology", "journalVolume": "7", "journalPages": "27-30", "doi": "10.14419/IJET.V7I4.42.25564", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.14419/IJET.V7I4.42.25564", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3113104527", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

In a large sample of manually collected U.S. deal contracts involving publicly traded bidders and targets, we examine the relationship between announcement returns and different types of RTFs, including those with features theorized by others to reflect inefficient design, and also RTFs that we theorize may send a negative value signal from managers seeking to \u201ceat\u201d rather than \u201cbe eaten\u201d in consolidating industries. We find inefficient RTFs correlate with lower bidder returns, even in a subsample where disclosure of RTF terms lags deal announcements by more than two days. We also find inclusion of certain RTFs in consolidating industries reveals private information to the market, resulting in negative abnormal returns. Our results are robust to alternative event windows and control groups, and carry over to combined bidder and target abnormal returns, inconsistent with inefficient RTFs reflecting transfers from buyers to targets. Finally, we find an insignificant relationship between the probability of deal completion and inefficient RTFs, and a negative significant relationship between the probability of deal completion and negative signal RTFs, consistent with the fact that deals with such RTFs are adopted in consolidating industries where both deal competition and antitrust issues are higher than in other deal settings.", "authors": [{"name": "John C.

It introduces a theoretical framework based on recurring structural policy windows' and argues that these types of windows should have a large effect on the intensity and timing of interest group activity. Using a new database of all lobbying expenditures in the U.S. states ranging up to 25 years, the paper shows interest group lobbying increases substantially during one of these structural windows in particular--the budgeting process. Spikes in lobbying during budgeting are driven primarily by business groups. Moreover, even groups relatively unaffected by budgets lobby more intensely during legislative budgeting, consistent with the theory that these interests are attempting to have legislators attach (de)regulatory riders to the budget bills. Overall, the paper demonstrates that these structural policy windows largely determine lobbying expenditures.", "authors": [{"name": "de  Figueiredo", "ids": ["6109048"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "M  John", "ids": ["145810199"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["869fc8ead662a2d99ef027485c5f890cfdb1abaa", "5505d6bfae7411197493f1c4f354034f0f8b7f91", "4f792938a6ccf87ce9d405fcb9e75f0b9b315dfc", "977398ee72c0d1b79dad47cd45f4b6ee9cbcc71f", "e3ca6f4401f27198c0ce7643d4465aa18a42950c", "178c5f56daad7c47c2614032ab4b11293875481d", "3f83a9cab172912c40fcf61623a573d0ee3a2e97", "79d190b62fbaf8618526fee650e4ab43896f9f5a", "f1edda19421853d3b5b5240a242053de457b71ce", "cc21858b7f7bd63a22b82641a6089a250f1f0cf5", "58382b952600c51560b336a0eb9cc034507cc675", "037a8c4b332a61cd37f0dca9d016868ac30068c6"], "outCitations": ["ba25f368aa6cc38f1a56f9e6a1d7cc8fea6faf4b", "70a5e27669cde4f612bec4656a8a9e17ad7df58f", "2a4872594fdc43c92e36f5be15c3f56731ecc0ee", "aac72d215e6e3542311b647a673d28d3f2718fe4", "b122649ddd0b42c94c97c2f0bd8747a98caf7367", "393b64cf6662e743ad9e99d19c7800432391222c", "941030471d57548dd01f2a98633b9dbb2f7562f4", "e345bee9e76a29335d6b801d1043952d22f801ff", "776006310320152ddbfa029503332d1de448c58d", "21ee9fc8610b9cde9edf76882f3532084cedd78f", "cbdd8b55a8034007bff42151e34158f3b3d3bf7a", "df8db85c93c60f5a6d4d8f089b01bbc930f47c05", "c83bebb97e97c519c8d215441c8f0eed588a4420", "3ca0b9fb0d9de23d2b36d5ed671609ec3b22a10d", "5286623216957cb44640d22b69c34b4045387be1", "d5f5d7e80bc14d3ae76889bc844165715475cd50", "8103d7035c79f85408c5ac090dfb56e00b9a8b1b", "7f583456d9b6137e2613a5218f02280aace6171a", "5517a9b168aa2da111e5e7b1c4c8d1600560e2e4", "c849611d0280d971249efa391d3a6c241b1cc42a", "2d1d5e21c99755fe7cfd316ed6de34dc789272fd", "e2217d53df8b94145c2b3f79bc59f2d88fb11141", "b3604c4fa91434eae6c0c52cae6b59c6a45430a3", "ccab606e9c185999d88138a5241426aef296f0e5", "94d8e0b0595450e46587f597a71c0d836ff9281f", "ed6420116c2a8e6f5d9ff30d9940a356be17d38f", "7a4cd496ba6336d6f2d0c2efe04f3a476fe9230c", "311a4986862ffb7a4e8a9bb7d5f0d86da7271445", "00db59442f2fbbd969e28a9f2e2db469ba531824", "4acb437acd6185dfd82bab5b6c623d3a9a87bba8", "7482d7d560d7233b5ebf56af870da012454aa1ac", "894fe9c15349ccf31a5c399a5add6c258274a8c8", "a4322f171d1fc2bd919b515439dc5ef531cbd801", "e41ca3e3df109c6869636c404b5f7bd5f45cd0cd", "546bb908544c33084e242258686681918bff1d05", "dfd931f2af8c8a8abe744d506c4d0525883a9354", "275cf2880490b57c8cd5e73f791cd4291244a30c", "038239d7a272db871ca8964a82b02102f11c74f8", "ff6e0c948af55d4a49c60965ebaac837f49dfb1a", "370e61dadfd19b4ed629461e02ba75b7ab70906e", "0f8a29a20881e44f2c64a1de264dd9b9acbaaccf", "e171c18786258838a7dafe61dc6bf9c98c8b3c8b", "371b49cdca668c1f2d5a333f02f38320931886cb", "84bb60e0efcff27c350ff5b64d3ff20f55c3f15c", "8d799fe69efe48611984b395468ad391dcf1164c", "17b9f523073dde7305d1f275534144d89af0c4bd"], "year": 2004, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/91ffc66c370c7cdb92b5b8b54de5ffa0f3d1ce46", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3108&context=faculty_scholarship&httpsredir=1&referer=", "https://www.nber.org/papers/w10588.pdf", "http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&context=alea", "http://web.mit.edu/jdefig/www/papers/state_lobby.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "National Bureau of Economic Research", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.3386/W10588", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.3386/W10588", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business", "Economics"], "magId": "165876384", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

This paper presents a theory of the choice between bank debt and public debt and then examines the theory using firm level data on borrowing sources in Japan. We find that high net worth companies are more prone to use public debt. We also find that the more successful members of industrial groups (or keiretsu) and less successful owner-managed firms tended to access the public debt markets. We offer a number of interpretations of these results in light of the theory.", "authors": [{"name": "Takeo  Hoshi", "ids": ["1724585"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Anil K.

Despite the advancements in this research area, multiple stakeholders' perspectives, as a social and non-technical research area, has been vastly underestimated in green buildings and sustainable development literature. This research aims to (1) examine the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of multiple stakeholders (e.g., architects, engineers, sustainability consultants, developers, contractors and suppliers) towards green building design and assessment process in the New Zealand Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, (2) explore motivations and barriers to green buildings on the national level and (3) identify and contrast each stakeholder group's motivations and barriers to adopting green building design standards and certifications. Data were collected from 215 multiple stakeholders in New Zealand using a KAP questionnaire survey. Statistical analysis using Kruskal-Wallis H test and Correlation tests (Pearson, Kendall and Spearman) were conducted to explore the relationships and differences in the KAP levels of the stakeholders. The results indicate adequate knowledge and positive attitude of the multiple stakeholders towards green building design and certifications. However, practices of green building design and assessment are still limited in New Zealand. The stakeholders' knowledge level is significantly and positively correlated with their attitude and practice. The results, moreover, reveal an attitude-practice gap among the multiple stakeholders which needs to be bridged. Practical implications are proposed to enhance the KAP levels of the multiple stakeholders and facilitate the adoption of green building design standards and certifications in New Zealand.", "authors": [{"name": "Fatma  Abdelaal", "ids": ["2121842183"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Brian H.W.

Paperback. Book Condition: New. 234 x 155 mm. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****.The world is awash with wine nearly 30 billion liters are produced every year. But how much is truly fine wine? Vastly less than what is claimed to be. By coining the term Grape-a-hol and defining it as an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grape juice and passed off as a substitute for fine wine, this book exposes the questionable practices of big business and the regulatory myopia of governments that are subverting artisan wine making, altering consumer tastes, and sabotaging the future of fine wine. Industry insiders themselves, the authors draw on their intimate knowledge of both the U.S. and New Zealand wine industries to reveal how the line between fine wine and bulk wine has become dangerously blurred. But it is not too late. Grape-a-hol is a rallying cry to everyone who believes it is only art not economics that can create truly fine wine. MICHAEL F.

The author finds that the different covenant arrangements come out different transaction cost, and the relationship and planning dictation covenant arrangements always replace or soften the covenant governance compulsively implemented by law, which result in the problem of soft constraint of credit contract during transformation period in China. To effectively prevent the breach of contracts, the commercial banks tend to protect themselves through multi-covenant governance which increase the transaction cost greatly. Thereby, the main reason of soft constraint of credit contract in China is the multi-covenant governance. From the view of game theory, every steady system is the equilibrium solution of gaming among people. The cost-saving function of different systems lead to the potential competition between themselves. The triple-governance of credit contracts is also the equilibrium solution of gaming in credit transactions and exists potential competition. With the improvement of marketilization and change of transaction cost, the law-implementation mechanism will replace relationship covenant and planning dictation covenant in credit contracts gradually.", "authors": [{"name": "YU  Di-feng", "ids": ["1450203069"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["f2e01402e58a641c066ffdaa607ed04844410df8"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2005, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8d4a372e8c64ab07776dd30aa721ef820e8523a3", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2372610091", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Methods include primary document review, a survey of partnership participants and quantitative analysis. This analysis identifies correlations between the quality of the collaborative process and changes in social conditions. In addition, although participants in the partnerships have implemented a range of watershed restoration projects, the influence of the process on implementation is ambiguous. The collaborative processes yield agreements, improve learning and build social capital; yet these alone may be insufficient to overcome barriers to implementation.", "authors": [{"name": "Lynn  Mandarano", "ids": ["94064501"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Kurt  Paulsen", "ids": ["104954655"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["2731a99e666f3675fd7221af3c783a5c0d7172b4", "0db075ac8eaa63675178583f8adc967d16341260", "6d28da3162fdad62680ae473db9fe6d4a744d325", "7bd2652adcf5a573ae6290def40f0029bad0bba7", "5e7fbcc08259bd2bda36a6e458ba68fccb1d7b23", "8ebe703aa0009fa72a1127d6cc0f83ceb1a79e8f", "e7d01a599ad472fe59a5cf7d3fce84b51f5f9445", "d986d17b5d33dbb02954ce383ba8e38223776690", "4cc92ddd20ae9610a14caa972046edbacc805b34", "9f1dd5baad4f0262d54cba32b0f49a4bb83f1ae4", "eb03c4a27c802a28fe7abba3b4a9f8840d29c107", "cc3362a1a5c00967129d61dee4f91f9a0c91b8cc", "21f234a723313e00817b42f195956be3b4d5a771", "2372627df4f16795e1445a1ff5e25992175af312", "df4dd8c4e1dc83875e4f45fbda387b484d2e5ccc", "fb1c2de631de8bed3c1a721368b5d4dfa199725b", "0744c67a5b84bbb22b34c2484f5aa21994edb288", "4fec14826dc14c6ed8e4af18a45d3883fa147ba3", "e58a3dc522480091aacb7113e8a420332e436247", "ae8691a48128972f9016328a60154396a792a3dc", "c7d0aa22e9e7f08a5e5adfa39719e285fa495abc", "a96014ad42ef05d54ff43cb96bf9ae0f5899cf07", "2c747c6d4a0232e3880a895f86925abe61ae1c50", "85b38eff3c99f19268adac5d4f08c0e29a275e32"], "outCitations": ["2fd0a0f7454fd492586eb1d4dbd83fb07dc806f1", "f13c0f34427185198bf0dbec794ba0d8b9242708", "f5a213e27942e6c3e16c89e38fd5b409fe628d57", "401e4b1a52724a64726bb135d997c6384f0bcc56", "557f827da5b843fbb6a9aafb0ade74f126ef1328", "7143261a384e88cb1a28c7e84165975709dc74aa", "bcbd002cbced58a60f99ecbf1c9e4a02d4e7752d", "b9746aedd11c029b904de92d246d1c79eee0d860", "f4d5ada3ef46e7ad84d93133d6faf4165fa6c530", "21f525b7bb8d4a1067afd8bf88f7a7aa36ba19a5", "565c914ee83c8a7ae5d6f305ca84cd3b65cb93de", "c9de7f9442c1517368b505c66712b3b6a7855c0f", "3805c1f476596b42677fe03b608510597a4574a2", "216d32d73d08defa2277f9662d89b1c94634fb8a", "50cfcae6ce52d20ca942a1701c00496d52e181ea", "3ed442feebbe5b43173665dc24f239ff754355e6", "5bceaf47b7d3fc522c08e5ea5e6ef83465ec57e6", "4eef02a88b22bba63e8c9f19ba572aa44dd33fe5", "a8d57010f6a4f3dce8e469566505c9b730734f54", "047537c75f4b25cfd6a9177751ee7ba00087b490", "9bffb2060e367dd6d0bfabf8169b72045eaec6ee", "b9569ed8a691f805f263a6aac91d9fc7a9104f2b", "eb1af0cb7f23ca9b3d7cf9961ccb6cd8597101a4", "39eca99d66b727c720aa719740f955b9f2bd49a1", "c934703f320dd6b2753b79196b0ef8f1a664bf61", "407143d51fe20b6fbff565e0996b11bd32feda23", "f9740a34a51630b24110c2685c2b157ce3c4a558", "7765f86bd8ed3ebe06c6fd8729aba03af9c2d3ab", "3fe4dbd016c4098bdadc44c4b70853ffef904441", "e4d6939d85ec3b535969e54f9bc54526ecc575fd", "c3e7c67462890ad1fdb840a2499b95f4327ed7a6", "9d2622347d6047c1b7c28cd51a2fa5e3dd2fb555", "04481b788cf006e032db680cc07a3dd8dac1ec49", "1490b0327265bece3e0cc92136fdac8ce228d2cc", "5c000b01fe6d76fc21df2412d6c3ec53612d5513", "107dbff1453bd0e9fd52b999e916eeb0af00084c", "6f6e4450ba27cb36c18925db037349753a4b199e", "33ceef792a8ab3a4aaabe730f4b9ccceb5f8c854", "894fe9c15349ccf31a5c399a5add6c258274a8c8", "ddf92ba1a5078effb15f63a6508858920a6eda76", "ff8570783603cc061667b17c379010cf096d49c5", "61ed86c5c00d9ea12ca454a6b0e508becc34e8e3", "c52f657964a8014e72d925768e2dcab23819abc5", "804792981d7b91d2a9c21441a49c25bc1767e216", "ee5756d64092ff0527cdb4e912c046204dfdffbd", "7179af43c3fee0d3377e494f56b6b9c8d21f6f0d", "f1f7964241c12d4c55e2c46195791c115f754080", "cb3b04e51a1424278ef6fe3fa87669142750bf08", "f42295273fdde7318472e0193617328c07284806", "e171c18786258838a7dafe61dc6bf9c98c8b3c8b", "0482906459c998d5c9fd15e7c4a7e45ec533cc92", "cb764bc51cb23ca62b3495f1bcdf01f9ad3219e9", "89ca80d88b329bffee31f469029b129e1fa1a525", "bc5d60ea489d4f4e0917add869b704f989d5c8f9", "320d3fe67ae52d0617749790b72dd42fff5c2554", "a96311ea2a4c3361c7defc64c681361e55226834"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fe231f2b4d53bbf14002623efe845443341606eb", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.urpl.wisc.edu/sites/urpl.wisc.edu/files/people/paulsen/Governance%20Capacity%20Collaborative%20JEPM.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Journal of Environmental Planning and Management", "journalVolume": "54", "journalPages": "1293 - 1313", "doi": "10.1080/09640568.2011.572694", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2011.572694", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2038561843", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Organ shortage means that, in addition to 'standard' deceased donor kidneys (SD), 'non-standard donor' (NSD), 'expanded criteria donor', or 'marginal' kidneys, which fail to meet standard criteria and are often associated with less good outcomes, are now being transplanted into selected recipients as a means of increasing the donor pool. A similar, but less-documented, practice has developed in living donation. This article outlines the clinical rationale and ethical argument underpinning the use of such donor kidneys and examines their legal status in the UK, which we claim remains largely undefined and untested. While it is probable that the general principles governing medico-legal consent and liability also apply to organ donation, the special circumstances of donation, notably the inadequate supply of donors and the emphasis on a 'gift relationship', make it difficult to know how far existing medico-legal precedents can or should apply. The non-standard status of deceased donor organs creates potential problems for the validity of 'appropriate consent' to donation required by statute. It may also be relevant to the use of interventions intended to optimise deceased donor organ quality. Furthermore, the SD/NSD distinction in clinical practice may produce unexpected legal effects. For example, the recent UK Regulations 2012, which bring into force the EU Directive on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation, could produce a negative legal restraint on the use of NSD kidneys. There is an urgent need for clarification of the effect of using NSDs in areas such as recipient and donor consent, liability for negligence, and the law of product liability. \u00a0Some argue that the need for non-standard organs results from society's failure to compel the retrieval of all suitable standard organs from the deceased as a community resource. However, the Human Tissue Acts of 2004 and 2006 (Scotland), which govern organ donation and transplantation in the UK, expressly require individual consent or authorisation in the decision to donate. This emphasis on individual autonomy appears to chime with prevailing public opinion. However, the sense of medico-legal security gained by uncritical observance of the existing law and of directives published under its authority may be an obstacle to the development of a system which adequately meets the needs of recipients while safeguarding donor autonomy.", "authors": [{"name": "Antonia J Cronin", "ids": ["1931068"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "James F Douglas", "ids": ["50745170"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["68890754450529b0771f717f23594d7902b75924", "ef9ed82138e8cf8a7d63fde226025f1c24b971d9", "2bc93b6c8b264d1a308fad42efa91d304a488758", "a49aa4447c94682342898f3883d9314347338ee0", "f52bab4414966b3bd2e8ca2b3d8df4009259f61f"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2013, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cb7058a218e6e828c6f821e92d025ab14a5bd168", "sources": ["Medline"], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "Medical law review", "journalName": "Medical law review", "journalVolume": "21 3", "journalPages": "\n          448-73\n        ", "doi": "10.1093/medlaw/fwt015", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1093/medlaw%2Ffwt015", "pmid": "23570691", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business", "Medicine"], "magId": "2002090966", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

The aim of the study into sustainable community development is to clarify the role of a community as a whole rather than the role of individuals within that community. Mixed methods of literature review and empirical study have been used to translate the knowledge and experience with urban sustainable development into empirical knowledge of a rural, market town setting. The exemplary case study is the Scottish market town Huntly. The main findings of the study show the need for three ingredients for a Community Sustainability Plan for a town such as Huntly. Community involvement is crucial in developing such plans in a rural setting. Further research in more remote settings, e.g. coastal and island communities, is needed to allow broader conclusions on rural sustainable development.", "authors": [{"name": "Joanneke  Kruijsen", "ids": ["41230203"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Alan  Owen", "ids": ["89287349"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Donald Murray Gordon Boyd", "ids": ["79503396"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["99a921089a6d32538aed7200c13a72831dc6222d", "c84386b750f75d0e996fed7071335ee2076fb838", "702d685bc23316f104fbbdba34b7624fc6732438", "ce6c0736a3c62f448717b8f3dcfd8f9e1938593e"], "outCitations": ["75666f885967748ea60aea6deda4dd4f0dee1e15", "3fbed55fe81362e54ed50e9dba028d0b9fa0b942", "304ccb5082281f80a87b7c3f431b74266e6a2a06", "e43eb6dbbf53a654c739b87b3d6745a5db41e25a", "0c8526b672f18f9617a5e5028fe3813d149e4c6b", "27a16ab2d895edef2a52e3cb0970ec4e1da291c1", "508140fd41d3816ff9523b57270f4795ac31cca0", "55f976bde1c4a955e633108f29761911d7ed72f1", "9a24218490f5e0e9f02aac05c1da853e90726704", "0c367e6ad2c2d9008509426db5a49f56f81c8ec8", "4617a6038ed77dfaae8c591df1f00f7b7e5854db", "29fe705f3a1091c5bfb0998db99f830c1c1350c9", "12a3594e90c38128983c89d0cc02ae6f0a4e17ab", "cc166aabb046f13df6bb05410c3f35dc52c905e8", "a78e2953491426d72c85e16862bc37e7338d9b16", "78ccf6aa17d4f4157b69b5f527703deef577019b", "ca3321800a7232604ea0bd0f0ac1d41236793f2d", "789ba356e469b65f4a2743925a5e725b27cc61d6", "ad95921626f26a1fc5aa2e7b18788c6b13678336", "290020b47855c55e349951b81bc7a4a6d33fc106", "c14363d37f8d9bae0b49b884c61e0b9db0a6774e"], "year": 2014, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/311e4b496228b8eafea4782e2c28fe98c462e4ba", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "Local Environment", "journalVolume": "19", "journalPages": "748 - 766", "doi": "10.1080/13549839.2013.792046", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2013.792046", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2041796350", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Because there tends to be an expectation that mine developers will finance tangible projects and services, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) could be an important vehicle for pacifying local communities, and minimising the impact of the abovementioned issues. This article contributes to this debate by examining the place of CSR in Kenya\u2019s nascent titanium mining industry. Through an ethno-ecological lens, it examines the extent to which CSR has managed to assuage the disaffection of the local community with the mining operations of the company Tiomin (K).

{"id": "6b2ff6f81157accabf08488786abd08d07a2acf8", "title": "The Central African Republic's Infrastructure: A Continental Perspective", "paperAbstract": "Between 2000 and 2005, infrastructure contributed less than 1 percentage point to the Central African Republic's annual per capita GDP growth, despite substantial spending in the road sector. Raising the country's infrastructure endowment to that of the region's middle-income countries could boost annual growth by about 3.5 percentage points. The CAR has made significant progress in the transport, water, power, and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors. But the high cost of fuel, which raises transportation and energy costs, has been a vexing issue across all infrastructure sectors. The CAR's most pressing infrastructural challenge lies in the transport sector, which relies heavily on neighboring countries and could benefit from improved road conditions and enhanced performance at the port of Douala in Cameroon. In the power sector, the country suffers from a deteriorating infrastructure stock that it can no longer afford to maintain, and an inefficient and unreliable power supply. Additional challenges include a need for improved infrastructure in the water and sanitation and ICT sectors. Addressing the CAR's infrastructure challenges will require sustained expenditure of $346 million per year over the next decade. The nation already spends around $134 million per year on infrastructure, with $37 million a year lost to inefficiencies of various kinds. If those inefficiencies were fully eliminated, the country's annual infrastructure funding gap would be $183 million per year. Improvements in funding, coupled with the prospect of an economic rebound and prudent policies, could lift the country from its fragile state back to and beyond the prosperity standards it once enjoyed.", "authors": [{"name": "Carolina  Dominguez", "ids": ["152686435"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Vivien  Foster", "ids": ["120257154"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["8e28ac4c2b011156939f695d79babd42da1a1c5c", "b2e48f06f6d09a19883e98cfe1783fd6d08b15db", "c3939fa1a840dbd5948a0109b03eea21bd26f25e", "67780591a2619dec0a3ab91f831f088a6658ad31", "e4d29eab0c10377bdbad79d47cf2cbd094ea68f9"], "outCitations": ["19e61811648682623d2582410b656ac5dab6e6c3", "0a863a7ab78f42e186beb82c2b6ac9229d06c38c", "ea0319ea38b70ca05a2daba7e1c6df62d26b38db", "b15d598685d8f4aa3e2c69eecea9fd77c41cb4d4", "594f6607cdf6eb802664666952900fb00d37f3d3", "7a65edc898c95c91863bc43b47f04b7435c1a3ae", "86088e90e0b5a22e680a77e96cd2155615c7d162", "93878a2a999d1a39e789f4341c7b0d36e0d4880c", "af55809cb984918290f1939755eb38a0a2c92d32", "4b2e11fc481805b3bf77610e7877498b2357a9b1", "eb63cc1441e2346bbde34e580ae58be1e84283d1", "8c050fa03303562576d95bcee43b17e3d33553ed", "2cf8c440241feed7259c00b3ff5061426188e1de", "2dcc81549dd45ef5fe8a40013dc5cadbedb5c527", "8393c9d2d76d9c7db8d258598e00a738b90c10da", "3343311221b28943d2af97dd6113e16110acc9cb", "9bdee40457d606773d2b54066870842d13d27913", "a54f8dd552011121b634ed887be216af94229234", "28fa355eef846e12407f348c6001a5058a3de7bc", "e4d29eab0c10377bdbad79d47cf2cbd094ea68f9", "8aebe87e6856bce7889e920db530107ccbcca026", "70fdb9926e6b7defa94ad0af50430984e1f74ff2", "1266a10da7815eaad4fbb95cbb01d659875fa5f1", "2b6606eefc07fdf69b9d75ce9ffae6e74dfed7ee", "c58a7e3cabb9b5c3cb7e6a67530a2c1888cc3f53"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6b2ff6f81157accabf08488786abd08d07a2acf8", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/3461/WPS5697.pdf;sequence=1", "http://siteresources.worldbank.org/CENTRALAFREXTN/Resources/AICD-CAR_Country_Report.pdf", "http://documents.vsemirnyjbank.org/curated/ru/445671468228231660/pdf/WPS5697.pdf", "http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/686861468211164727/pdf/627990WP0P124200BOX361491B00PUBLIC0.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Political Economy: Government Expenditures & Related Policies eJournal", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.1596/1813-9450-5697", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-5697", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "1882869515", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

The result challenges the perception that credit ratings provide reliable guidance to fixed-income investments and has important implications for risk management and credit pricing.", "authors": [{"name": "Chunsheng  Zhou", "ids": ["72529238"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["18ba439b43604e1a00dcdcf8b00a4cb7d3d76dd8", "c2f385d61ca579c8260f331593f3b41d972723da", "357ea647281cbcde94d3fade422fe173abfe9c57", "601d4ab7be28c998eb1c31b53c1015fa0d641d41", "de2676f69410cac4951078b70e04c30750775103", "b094e5f1bb192ace43e8a8d4b877efe9ae96a623", "779e73117092f3666258eda267582ca0bd829519", "49d096d0b83a42e1ae7f6d9d36d6814754b2c29c", "b07d19e6d8d1e51f076dad7e6da59bcf7ebf002f", "406bfb71236c30f6f4efbd3133d581ba87a0c503", "a0e07b84c3cab26a2bce8301cbf161a4fc916f5e", "ae3b5f4d500a047ab1fb42560ee535ea864fa799", "33037decf2213eef38ff553cd6c75376c495b38f", "2d553352230ec2f6fdda12ec8fdf0a21175b066b", "4cacddd3abe72246b8dac96aacd1b3dd5ae6eda3", "114a3767c0a6fb5a6c113cae51a6d20ddbb3fd01", "41f8e6ed5aaf9e4a9f6fb286e80d92818e2cb1ba", "0f4cc1d93045c7ee236b068f0834a3583708f4a4", "d7ac83994bd2638e153d73ef81182b4ae42c62d4", "94867d7920ef93002a1bac18e450456d7b5282fa", "6b6c87f25d71a46f8f51a2b6b0a1d3c00d764d8c"], "outCitations": ["8d2e34f1c06c279e5c5ebe56c935e7617fca93b3", "588778f1c9ccd82ef1744f6c20535bb54e236753", "e6a10c19444baea3303efa4f24c89aca1202c0ff", "b0886bb49a9d66bf60e7ea4e2c30f391668eca6f", "d266e48f41d8dc589395b5d92e3ee9bb30f73fba", "92db56d3cc6386338047cbad3ab886618cc735a7", "e4e0534ce21fd0987ab0463e3cd8e18da3d1df5a", "707a79fb44fc8749c7e983e3f21681d16a82fd04", "d06f068ab1e02a84e6ab5a97cbd4d79dd5f36082", "204ed159307aa98e9ccbc5389b4f5d707f6a73ee", "f2e844cb71a25c07f85598d1a968c34bbb13c616", "6fba0fe15f0c9dbb6b6a0cd2f569c9cfefc3f18a", "f2eba85bfddd5a62eb42ec743660f24fdca88432", "7a1d697be061d20c5b09afceaa1fdfbf5de766bf", "35e1781dc3400e1f694b2ca3f28fd1d05ca0fe5a", "1ac0d5ddb021b98ca10d63fe6374bd1294f138c6", "2982ae5ac0f8bc7142d2e0c39b6b9aee49db2d38", "13ca4a9d128a5b2e18f8404aef0e77af2957070f"], "year": 2001, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/97088754a95c983914db66c7da74fe7342b06164", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "11", "journalPages": "30 - 40", "doi": "10.3905/jfi.2001.319303", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.3905/jfi.2001.319303", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2092245970", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

For these companies GMO contamination can lead to extensive losses such as decreased product value, recall expenses or decreased brand equity. The question that occurs in many food producing and processing companies is how to manage the risk of GMO contamination most effectively. The objective of this paper is to show how food companies manage the risk of GMO contamination. Because of the complexity of the German food sector the analysis focuses on one supply chain namely: the production, processing and trading of maize and maize products. Within this supply chain an assessment of potential losses and safety measures was conducted in a two-step analysis. At first personal interviews with executives or quality managers of companies along the whole supply chain were carried out. Then the results of these interviews were analyzed and used to create the framework for a second session of formalized online interviews within companies of the maize chain. The results of the survey in maize producing, processing and trading, companies show the risk of potential losses that can occur in case of GMO contamination. Additionally the results show the safety measures that can effectively reduce the risk of GMO contamination.", "authors": [{"name": "B.

We apply the Energy Technology Innovation System framework to evaluate the distribution of directed innovation efforts between the SET Plan priority areas in 2015. First, we review relevant literature on innovation system frameworks and their application for evaluating strategic policies like the SET Plan. Second, we develop a set of indicators for measuring innovation system functioning. Third, we identify available EU-level data from a wide range of sources. Fourth, we collect data on relevant indicators to characterise the EU energy innovation system in the priority areas identified by the SET Plan. Finally, we draw conclusions about the functioning of the EU's SET Plan from an innovation systems perspective by analysing the distribution of innovation efforts. We find that EU-level innovation system activity is relatively balanced across renewables, electric vehicle and energy efficiency and unbalanced across carbon capture and storage and nuclear safety.", "authors": [{"name": "Yeong Jae Kim Charlie Wilson", "ids": ["120004827"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["a3e8b40f34959daaed05ca06575c8bec9a3543d3"], "outCitations": ["d274b52954930784df0e12f83d28377ae679de3e", "e2699f8984a4253862a7430d5a61ad59db007d4a", "a512af2d18dde4db9789bcc132eff21c1300ef38", "db401b6f3d41079538de7146a9ad075375761381", "c80e50ce2812a8fb8da3d4ffa5260804a2531d0f", "77f966844937b47de4943be0aa5b7ac4cd7c7e0a", "b34d677b85e24cb071940b9288a73317cd46976a", "eaa387f58975862b7b2c53da45e541eb34ede748", "686df55bafc8bdcb80a2f72f6ffbd882db37f694", "df9e7d6ab595bcda2826411376ee9f62d3950d99", "edb5e092911a3197196b822dfd3c90ed4568f13c", "1b12c6cd8e4387f0c8ba852949eaca0be1ae2045", "e69dd056014a227ec8654604f7bf8ce61cd77842", "9658e45ae4b60af901960f5b2d09e71d82d5e03f", "095fb0375fce21a3f32dcd36d310437f6a993801", "d74863d73e4bd8ed64e3bd18290d059762c52211", "cc6ea88af43cdb8e9ad2cf364e774bf4279b4889", "161921e5807cb75fde6a761ff3861129442170a6", "e6177c005d8871d10a0a3e954cb538ab2ffe1764", "90df2be0394c21bea729f90389652f91768cd81b", "121351ca86314819e086051c8934a0af20abe01e", "a89370ed499520a2495d0631ef2bf90d325ac230", "03afefff4ea479cfcf9253a50a471fcc81d6bdfe", "43963b810bf8903138e08f73e4ecbc441e1ab814", "3c20a2aaba178cef9f7d31b5d8d83f137f515b0e", "a6f417e87646e436e8aff6a14ede84e46ba6a224", "e63d37cc40c42ba9b19b3cb35d356f6fed330f00", "dea7aa1e6001a5bf271e27131ed7e977e5314f1f", "336865dd775ef6188bbb0579b1bf4d977cbbf535", "490369507b3a1e425ff4b7150fc9d083783bb908", "39e49de1de45ce4d166d068e8ce5ecb41931b664", "28d2866ffec9daca23c28e092ff46c24393871b9", "cb6ab17c2dc4e45185a63292d30889af58cdf22e", "baf7784cd7eb088c10ddfc52fd7a3e42c1ea42aa", "94c5fd3808ebe42ce08124be27479eaca7b44619", "b1a1d54581ab196d41cf1ca4a238ed26cb256f78", "49eaf1dcf08a8235497f97cc2ec58f3b7081c217", "367b8e9d07f4bbc768d50e4e284a1c4349cc62c4", "9a1ab29153bf8bc1f04754f6f116a4fe7b4b824f", "5c40e30542ec90649f5c24de1366821cae369b0d", "e53a213460b382cd8d7f8a2923b0cd2101dd40cc", "62e26845fbbeb685b86e74e289046ecfd558ad00", "0be84d5ff5cb42d146aad1ba899706bef9ce789c", "5d0f88e8fed5400efb4b7c0a4c3660beb631d1a9"], "year": 2017, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3c64c9107f442a897d4dd86ea196e06ffeeea931", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/proceedingsabstractpdf.aspx?id=14599", "https://www.eeg.tuwien.ac.at/conference/iaee2017/files/paper/559_Kim_fullpaper_2017-09-15_20-51.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2914677057", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

This stepwise process extracts, article metadata, illustrations and their captions, bibliographic references, scientific names, named geographic entities such as coordinates and country names, collection codes, and finally, taxonomic treatments. These extracted data are enhanced and published in TreatmentBank (http://plazi.org) and deposited in Biodiversity Literature Repository (https:/biolitrepo.org) respectively, in which a Digital Object Identifier (DataCite DOI) is minted for articles as well as their contained figures and taxon treatments, each linked to each other in their metadata. This input is complemented by the import of Journal Article Tag Suite/Taxpub XML based publications from Pensoft publishers (e.g. Zookeys, Journal of Hymenoptera Research; https://pensoft.net/browse_journals) that are semantically enhanced during their journal production workflow. Upon import, materials citation are discovered and parsed, and the taxonomic treatments added to TreatmentBank where a persistent identifier is minted. From TreatmentBank data from taxonomic treatments, including occurence data from cited specimens, are submitted to GBIF (http://gbif.org), or are accessible via API. Treatments and material citations from more than 26,200 articles have been registered. The articles can be found on GBIF using the Digital Object Identifier in the search field. \n Plazi, together with Pensoft Publishers, has processed over 26,000 articles containing more than 284,000 taxonomic treatments, 190,000 images, 50,000 georeferenced materials citations, together comprising an estimated 100 million facts. Through the support of the Arcadia Fund (https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/) Plazi's processing is expanding to cover a sufficient number of journals to liberate the data of over 50% of the new described animal species annually. This will complement an existing service provided to the Mus\u00e9um National d\u2019Histoire Naturelle, Paris, to convert the European Journal of Taxonomy and their other journals (http://sciencepress.mnhn.fr/en/periodiques/adansonia/40/1) to JATS/TaxPub (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK47081), as well as an increasing portfolio of journals published in JATS/TaxPub by Pensoft Ltd.", "authors": [{"name": "Donat  Agosti", "ids": ["2945263"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Terry  Catapano", "ids": ["2719046"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Guido  Sautter", "ids": ["1802761"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Willi  Egloff", "ids": ["6552763"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["ad1e6294d484400dee5809b77b79a9555f9f689e", "563dd4c2c65908c738d7f4111ac2e61c6ea9ac10", "fd2eef483eb2e857ec271802fc43dae3e0a3e9c0", "84668701a07db300cf2c3815029c1a3c2bef3d25", "64fad26b1537e7be5a7691f71f555a400ac4f064"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2019, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5376a10f915a71b7c867210bc453a3b259c1b31f", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://biss.pensoft.net/lib/ajax_srv/generate_pdf.php?document_id=37046&file_id=0&readonly_preview=1"], "venue": "Biodiversity Information Science and Standards", "journalName": "Biodiversity Information Science and Standards", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.3897/BISS.3.37046", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.3897/BISS.3.37046", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2953185668", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

{"id": "7ea237218b3490d9076b7d17531810ea80a39045", "title": "SUPPLY CHAINS FACING ATYPICAL DEMAND: OPTIMAL OPERATIONAL POLICIES AND BENEFITS UNDER INFORMATION SHARING", "paperAbstract": "Demand patterns for products with seasonality and or short life-cycles do not follow a clear discernible pattern (to allow predictive time-series modeling of demand) for individual sales events or seasons due to such factors as considerable demand volatility, product promotions, and unforeseen marketplace events. Suppliers supporting such atypical demand patterns typically incur higher holding costs, lower capacity utilization, and lower order fill-rates, particularly under long lead-times and uncertainty in effective capacity. Retailers on the other hand struggle with product overages and supply shortages. On the other hand, atypical demand settings bring huge financial opportunity to supply chain players, and are pervasive. It is suggested in the literature that an effective means to reap these benefits is through increased information sharing between retailers and suppliers, superior forecasting with forecast update techniques, proper replenishment, and custom designed inventory/manufacturing policies. We also believe that sharing of order forecasts, also known as soft-orders, in advance by the buyer could be beneficial to both parties involved.\n\nThis dissertation in particular studies a two-player supply chain, facing atypical demand. Among the two-players is a buyer (retailer/distributor/vendor) that makes ordering decision(s) in the presence of upstream supply uncertainty and demand forecast revision(s). We propose a stochastic dynamic programming model to optimally deicide on soft-order(s) and a final firm-order under a deposit scheme for initial soft-order(s). While sharing of upstream soft-order inventory position information by the supplier before receiving a final order is not a common industrial practice, nor is it discussed in the literature, our analysis shows that such information sharing is beneficial under certain conditions.\n\nSecond player of the supply chain is a supplier (manufacturer) that makes production release decision(s) in the presence of limited and random effective capacity, and final order uncertainty. Our stochastic dynamic programming model for optimal production release decision making reveals that substantial savings in order fulfillment cost (that includes holding, overage, and underage costs) can be realized in the presence of advance soft-order(s). Soft-orders can also be shown to improve order fill-rate for the buyer.\n\nThis research explores complex interactions of factors that affect the operational decision making process, such as costs, demand uncertainty, supply uncertainty, effective capacity severity, information accuracy, information volatility, intentional manipulation of information etc. Through extensive analysis of the operational policies, we provide managerial insights, many of which are intuitively appealing, such as, additional information never increases cost of an optimal decision; many are also counterintuitive, for example, dynamic programming models cannot fully compensate for intentional soft-order inflation by the buyer, even under conditions of a stable and linear order inflation pattern, in the absence of deposits.", "authors": [{"name": "Pundarikaksha  Baruah", "ids": ["20107905"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["58ab8b95389e8eeb597bf4f05235a652999b3d66", "21aa99916d4f54bc2feb1ad438756624510feba2", "7e0171b61c0b8a0f52bfef7b4189ecfe60faf1c8"], "outCitations": ["802a926583bced33af7422daaab1bce2fc5e0465", "6ac5f15d1f6de6b08fa47e5d51b2d9e3db2c10c4", "6b373ea708f3abdff7a7a6aaf55a444ab237b8a7", "fc79ac6b4f1746d1689ecc77fd6eddac8f47b602", "7979384c07b54d44153cde9c726906d52c3085c5", "b3ce40a70dd09a842cadafee7d73725147ae68ef", "833f1dcd7ae2466bf0b8b8826bca509ba5ec3ddc", "3f623e638a5edc1f1ec04c59e9c6bdde44c6ceb0", "bb9cda8e64cbd2b22dcfffe543ba96ad23348618", "4977e80d034b1d0253c862a0a9d427253a4ca461", "29e599e8f946a50d3474ca505d34d289d957d035", "d13a4ea6ced7243ca0940a9df09b0b3f4d83f413", "0022cc4918879868bf1af5f7e4bfac61f54d7eea", "9d98a28e71e39a4e78d0f55d6a7b09605345cbce", "e31bca20febec67f6c07c1bea00e772c5348b6d3", "81352afbaefbee265a27556ce94b3a53ccfdba9d", "98566c191ebd218019ad261981b8015adf5741c5", "3662c9ba8315d33751f0d01230e52c74517ff754", "40cec43b6870565f0e641f8b0319cc234a9d7154", "6e9f4d6cfba5c34a4299cea43ba5821149d927c8", "b94aac6fe6fd16a42db87563b9f6317c9177807a", "72ffcce6dc4adc12b160c061fc35e88f65342a9e", "7d55b0b073162df9bdf6995d33e8838e18dbddd3", "1cabe4d3fa94753e82bbbb974c5d1390f88e822c", "b5a982e0295d3070141a10f1719a8e27cb05b8b0", "6e5d95cdd0de7144f4d186e397d712cbd67ca318", "2c813b6ac8ebb65e7b1c28f3adedbb1132bbff9d", "51e24f3f29123558af791ad40b27cf825dc488f6", "2291624b26fd88278f917cce1fc12d9cbf058ffc", "8192fd6ae487240a7f15c042319a5be47cf83958", "9afb6178fef3ad3bee672a706bc5b45b1f86bdf6", "a7a60923ac45e02345d6343e554f0fd1fcc236a2", "d6e2cd59cc3496c5b5286bd6dc658d8661c94fdf", "ac1021171263ff726aae4d2b56f3264243049cae", "a5a9b5f58e638548ef223c44cc9108ec0d2f85dd", "f42ce262be6020c7fe7b39014dc71868da09038c", "6c6cfa4c7662a92d422e5f17763f0091108a33bd", "bd02cb4e8a50c03aa3a5b24c4d55e5b21f8e2509", "c427c260ec861155ba3c884eae983d605cce1d8f", "f631db5b2de924a068afb70e5c70ace0a7476260", "e47e100eaedbc0341e0cf8b4b845295f5da90dc7", "b88a25dd9cc2fa2cf823af76508c0948a3579eb6", "71ca98b44c0b42d6cbfc77964dbc3bcb14cc3898", "70f6f070f45afdd58b85cafde3a2e9ea02f3fcdb", "934106d59e04b3aa090fd403027a240a4579b211", "c8b0e6a3bbfd6bc9854ab02e92aa382c0f7516f8", "1423e36dc8dae597e77a2cbe8b6a0aedad80dd73", "237291a975cb5effcbd9b908e1f6cc9dc8a149f5", "94ecb3f5611e6c1bce8835ed70c6a6200e682e5f", "66ba4d3d30a60d914141d63345934366004b790a", "be4c93283f1720e6e1c7ed01a73835f71cbe5bc7", "1028bf9129871e904f6c802696829da38b1c41e5", "80bb4563b1b276c0be09f582a3f433743fafefd2", "99b522af160879aff98416a4d053bea69f8c5068", "7d3c1f4d04d7768cc2789265bfd24d37e6835791", "cd6143f68b6d6c8ee48816b1bd92f63e526ff4fd", "d82492fe2ebd88bb5a7124d6e390d8428b519095", "a3809013a4abf71b096daf1a49c2b8e60a22142c", "b8aee90af34106347cf1b5921571da2b31b2ffab", "c157c17cce09fef7caf71e1bdaa4c20e45e3ffb7", "8ed64290a490f797f50625ff735ba375bb45d5c9", "b802c0b138844cee98e4d67c22e1b0841b60c626", "6c719f8f61b2f785954164bb741425c3cf2c0d89", "18f7ad878dabf11015b137ebe9ab4c1d338214bd", "165102d9fa2d8bacc7a75146a01e8b7be6575c40", "caf5f4c2782cc0ca5c51427fe99b20ffbe694896", "9cf466ce0fce8897f6e5d1d366eeb62c4a10fd63"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ea237218b3490d9076b7d17531810ea80a39045", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://engineering.wayne.edu/faculty/baruah-_dissertation.pdf", "https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/16101/1/MPRA_paper_16101.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Research Papers in Economics", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "1730355271", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

The study examined the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the stated women and analysed their roles and operations. Data collection was through the administration of 60 structured questionnaire and scheduled interview.\u00a0 Data were analyzed using simple percentages, tables and frequency while the SWOT analysis was employed in the deduction of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The study revealed their challenges to be financial, lack of basic amenities, health issues, fluctuating sales and demand, land tenure system, low literacy and training, high indebtedness, family responsibilities and gender inequality. Their strengths were: Population of the women, skills and experience, diversity of fishes in Otuocha community, location of natural water body, Omambala river and low production cost in the study area. However, their opportunities were; producers of successors, presence of fisheries organizations, large market for the fish, creation of value-added fish products, and geographical location of the community market. Their threats were: Competition from other women fisherfolks, lack of modern processing equipment, cultural/traditional forces limiting women from active fishing and seasonal flooding. Availability of loan by financial institutions is therefore recommended to enable women acquire needed facilities. Awareness should be created on gender issues affecting fishing activities of women in Otuocha. There should be periodic training and workshop for the women fisherfolks, there should be formation and strengthening of women's organizations on professionalization of both harvest and post- harvest activities. Women should be involved in decision making in all aspects of fish value chain processes.", "authors": [{"name": "G. T. Obuakor", "ids": ["2101213943"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "K. P.

The purpose of this paper is to determine these future research proposals of LM which are country-related and classify them.Design/methodology/approachA systematic literature review (SLR) of peer-reviewed journal articles in LM was conducted. A total of 145 articles published in 34 journals during 2010\u20132020 were collected from four major management science publishers namely, Emerald Online, Elsevier/Science Direct, Springer Link and Taylor and Francis. The country-related future research proposals of LM identified in the literature were classified according to, firstly, the continent of the country of reference, and secondly, some form of natural affinity of these proposals creating meaningful themes. The quality tool \u201caffinity diagram\u201d was applied to classify the country-related future research proposals of LM.FindingsThe country-related future research proposals of LM, which are increasing in the literature over time, refer mostly to studies to be conducted in several continents/countries and to multinational studies. Conducting studies specifically in Asia, Europe, South and North America, Africa and Australia\u2013New Zealand is also suggested. The plethora of the country-related future research proposals of LM were classified, based on the affinity of their content, into 18 meaningful themes. These themes were also classified based on their affinity into two broad categories, namely \u201cthemes concerning the LM approach itself\u201d and \u201cthemes concerning factors outside the LM approach\u201d.Research limitations/implicationsThe restricted number of the databases searched and the subjectivity of classifying the large number of the country-related future research proposals into themes are the main limitations of the present SLR. Based on these limitations, future literature review studies can be carried out.Practical implicationsUseful proposals are provided to researchers of several countries for conducting original and country-specific research studies which can enrich the knowledge of the implementation of LM under the specific circumstances of a country for the benefit of practitioners.Originality/valueThis study goes beyond previous literature review studies on LM by focusing exclusively on the LM future research agenda which is country related. The analytical presentation of the country-related future research proposals as well as the formulation of clusters of these proposals make the present SLR study substantially different from those carried out worldwide so far.", "authors": [{"name": "Evangelos  Psomas", "ids": ["3245162"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["7604b60a78d235068377511aa09561f5afee2f7c",

Even though the animal health organization was a relatively small part of the total transaction, there were still ambitious financial goals that had to be met to make the merger viable for Pfizer and Pharmacia shareholders. Meeting investor\u2019s financial expectations required achieving rigorous revenue targets while also overcoming the numerous complexities of integrating two similar yet different organizations. As in any merger, there were predictable undercurrents of doubt, anxiety and skepticism among managers and employees from both organizations. To make matters worse, rumors circulated that the new animal health business would be spun off to help finance the merger of the human pharmaceuticals business. While the new field-based sales and technical organizations were clearly anxious, so was the cadre of middle managers, many of whom had little experience in merging two businesses and even less experience in the art of managing the essential cultural aspects of integration. Most managers believed they had more important things to do: new sales territories to cut, company cars to swap, expense reporting systems to implement. And if that were not enough at the time of the merger, Pfizer employees in one major segment of the division were already preoccupied with implementing a significant change in business strategy. These distractions adversely impacted the ability of employees to achieve the ambitious integration goals their management had set. Knowing that most mergers fail because management does not successfully address cultural issues between the two companies, Pfizer leaders recognized the need to create a common framework for working together and achieving results among divergent business practices. The new company needed quickly and proactively to build trust and commitment among leaders and employees if it were to minimize the potential for misunderstanding, misdirection and lack of confidence in leadership. It was also imperative to engage every level of the organization in a teambuilding process that gathered input from employees, not only about their fears and anxieties, but also their ideas about how to make the new organization work. This article outlines the unique challenges Pfizer Animal Health faced during the recent integration and describes the Jump Start process, a change management tool developed and used throughout the corporation to accelerate the integration process.

{"id": "e88930da859c02880c6f4eccd724527f3831a5a1", "title": "An empirical investigation of environmental performance and the market value of JSE listed companies", "paperAbstract": "In the recent past, there has been increasing awareness of, and concern for, the impact that many companies are having on the natural and social environment. This has seen the emergence of a triple bottom line approach to business, with environmental and social metrics being used in addition to financial metrics when evaluating company performance. Despite the growing level of investment in corporate sustainability, it is not clear whether these investments are viewed positively by the market, and to what extent it creates shareholder value. To shed light on the relationship between environmental performance and financial performance, this research assignment used the event study methodology to investigate whether there is statistically significant stock market reactions to announcements relating to the environmental performance of companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. A total of 260 news announcements related to environmental performance were collected from a variety of news sources. The 260 news announcements represented 67 different companies across 11 different industry sectors. News announcements were collected from several prominent business news sources including the Business Day, Financial Mail and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service. Abnormal share returns were estimated for a three day event window around the announcement date by using the market model approach. Results were aggregated based on four different categories of environmental performance, including corporate environmental initiatives, environmental awards and certificates, negative environmental publicity and, environmental reporting, permits and licences. Consistent with related research in developed countries, this study found that the market rewards certain categories of positive environmental performance but penalises certain categories of negative environmental performance more severely. The results show that there is a significant positive market reaction to announcements of corporate environmental initiatives on the trading day following the announcement. This result indicates a positive relationship between corporate environmental initiatives and financial performance, as measured by market value. In terms of negative environmental performance, it was found that the market responds negatively to the broad category of negative environmental publicity. In particular, negative announcements from civil society and environmental groups seem to result in more significant market reactions than negative announcements from local or national government. In contrast to some studies done in developed countries, no statistically significant relationship was found between announcements of environmental awards and certificates and the market value of companies. Neither was there a statistically significant relationship between environmental reporting, permits and licences and the market value of companies.

Invented in the wake of Australia\u2019s socio-political \u2018back-to-the-land\u2019 aspirations of the 1970s, PC has since developed and grown into a diverse international grassroot movement. It can be considered a rural as well as an urban socio-cultural phenomenon that revolves around non-commercial gardening, for example urban community projects, or around farming for self-sufficiency, for instance in eco-villages. This paper intends to investigate which aspects of PC may be scalable to commercial farming whilst identifying PC aspects already implemented in commercial (organic) agriculture (OA). It analyses a current business case led by a German wholesaler of organic produce who worked in cooperation with a German supermarket chain to create the first nationwide PC label. To this end, the paper describes the degree of overlap between two organic farming certification schemes and the case study. As opposed to certified OA, PC is less prescriptive, using a deductive and inductive approach instead. It may expand scope and flexibility required for farm redesign towards improved resilience, reaching out to the landscape level. The productiveness of PC in commercial settings needs to be established further, such as best practices in soil regeneration and monitoring as well as the reduction of soil losses, or the valuation of added ecosystem services such as promotion of (agro-)biodiversity.", "authors": [{"name": "Immo  Fiebrig", "ids": ["10430996"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Sabine  Zikeli", "ids": ["5935997"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Sonja  Bach", "ids": ["143972087"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Sabine  Gruber", "ids": ["51188461"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["dd7da2c91f602aecbc15fa37a57ad0ece249b885", "a2dfb004fa62ed7e689925415c3e9ab546c52325", "11d38912b4aed408e70c20013328046fbadc46e9", "fb0a769c732a7ed871f48a1d6d9be1e656ae9a26"], "outCitations": ["afccfe8fd657df987de0c8f26bde5f0696b0a83d", "54701b74452cab65868fbe11ba25f01389504e82", "302a79dc09c660ab693d1f23442c8cf663754cea", "39c6781e7e13c833b84513e30833cbac93e60a6a", "332d4e7950ea583b7755f37fadf8c536d35876c1", "5a706b68b15253586b787684b8552c84794f92ea", "702b6e7d66bb15078c8d69518ce2a282f5b66836", "5d32dde329ba7c412e98944c62d09ef7cf9fd3ff", "6f9f2157c1873d14ca13526a355fe96f413d8653", "ceb430c32f9771e5ea71f1616c2994746bb041f0", "9e50ff0e329f7e6711e89a63b1bf8c1990f1f02f", "0123c981d3fe988d08fab73ff576db7f1528c9c1", "e2166ea33f914deac29761659d3d2554b5a3ef68", "7dc0c2d878964aa50ea430258b53a40580ac2949", "ddc595be73fac39da6d091a00cac2bc4ef142429", "c43b020008542b60a1d30ff2f82521b66ffbe866", "729725678a041fc18cb5103f70252dd5e6ddd54a", "69a8298661976b0487f49ef12ee5bbc4ea20cff4", "a0e85ee84f0100ba9613ff24959f998b81c0e86a", "b39e9a908a55ec5a562a266e78acf9cb18101fd7", "8af71489a0bc75e09e053432e028b352b57593c9", "b1fff1b78e320b885bed09648f4ad7e4c2290252", "2427de4c0a2e4a8538349a989784f7d504d54279", "ca3321800a7232604ea0bd0f0ac1d41236793f2d", "e86ef768c470c192f39db4d7afe6604ae21ffddb", "a26c09e39d14a86b09d9309f2ac2510e7472c4d8", "d619af4c55e9dc0cadf847d6e3657e8affbf9de1", "fae5987228a205e170a9888871cae17176b09140", "b8496b17c1a4a2a851fd97407b515005711c9859", "d9d3ef0b9d22500453ed4c9f295ffcfdd1c820ac", "451ba5d15899867acbe2c41e14387e5eb6539971", "01fba2388522075d8a5493b71e75b14785aabfc2"], "year": 2020, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d118a0e3430afcbdc449bc84f1fa4de784840ee3", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "Organic Agriculture", "journalName": "Organic Agriculture", "journalVolume": "10", "journalPages": "379-394", "doi": "10.1007/s13165-020-00281-8", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s13165-020-00281-8", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3002966659", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

There are many arguments about the impacts of subway pricing on residents\u2019 travel. This paper aims to examine the existing arguments by looking at Beijing as a case. Beijing municipal government decided to change subway fare from a flat fare of RMB 2 (0.35 USA cents) to a distance-based price system since 28th December, 2014. The paper investigates the impacts of an increase of subway fare on individual people\u2019s travel trips. A before-after approach is applied to compare passengers\u2019 travel characteristics before and after the ticket price changed. The data is from a survey which collected 788 questionnaires at 32 subway stations. The results of analysis show that 9.01% of the respondents reduced their travel frequency of subway. Among these reduced trips, 71.8% are commuting trips and 24% are shopping trips. Apparently, there are obvious social variations in the change of trips in terms of people\u2019s income, ages, housing types and residential location, etc. The increase of subway fare would have effects on social inequity as the quality of living to some disadvantaged people are particularly affected, such as low-income, the young, the elderly, and those who live in suburban renting housing. For the future policy, targeted subsidy policy should be considered in order to promote a more equal and affordable public transport in Beijing.", "authors": [{"name": "P  Zhao", "ids": ["46737574"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Y  Zhang", "ids": ["121310652"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["70f755aaa4ff2c8b2f7736e27b6cc2cf59059638", "9112e2f84b2bb16738e9d5e34a844262fdba10f3", "2058d143e9281a89e3ea6dd0bd414841161f68fe", "cf8ea2f6b636e1228f1d6d5e840011035263f9b0", "c3d06872767ef8dbcdefbcd19dc355dd36944b8b", "0113972a7881d04bfd4364b5c3d3568e2af41176", "41a075e75776f5674fb1f222a232e603b78bf2ff", "05a86b64494bda4755beb71215ad29a7b4ae7184", "527c819c2107fdf7051590bd53bba608152ee387", "f1b22a03edea2f91b497de7ada1bd38570bb5e98", "e2cd980c318a9c78d8fb68b6d396f45abd5ec349", "4c590cdab251a628a66cb1cc0064d191922e67e4", "5e623c38017b065797b92a1b10c996545a06ea2a", "cea57598f70a2cc4ce80bc50cbc005528faa7502", "2530ca54be468a0367f8ada3565f82d59bddef3f", "20e7a46c98872e159bf6c42dd544988ce93f32d7"], "year": 2016, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4684a3d28fa10b505191f377e76cd4a93383e4d3", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "272-281", "doi": "10.1061/9780784479810.030", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1061/9780784479810.030", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2400456849", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

However, more assertive attention is justified on the basis of qualitative as well as quantitative evidence. Neither unrestricted medical paternalism nor total patient autonomy should be unequivocally endorsed.

Total Quality Management is an approach used in running a business to maximize the competitiveness of an organization through continuous improvement of its services, products, processes and environment. Total Quality Management according to Josep M. Juran Quality is the suitability of a product use (Fitness For Use) which is to meet customer needs and satisfaction. Josep is often referred to as \"the Father of Quality\" by using the concept of the Quality Trilogy thinking, namely Quality Planning, Quality Control and Quality Improvement. Integrated quality management (Total Quality Management) has success in the business world and impacted on other organizations including educational institutions to implement it. But there is still much debate about TQM applied in management education. Total Quality Management (TQM) needs to be done in every activity of the organization, so that the goals of the organization can be achieved and the investments made have not been in vain. With TQM, it can also be used to assess the ability of existing human resources (HR) to plan human resource improvements and organizational strategies in the future.", "authors": [{"name": "Kamila Ida Suwarno", "ids": ["1658881149"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2020, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2578893d4c3d7062043918d25c27fb654268de31", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "28-39", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3012435951", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

The evaluation sheets and check lists of rating companies and banks have been introduced shortly within this chapter. New technologies with not existing deep experience, like bifacial energy gain, cannot get rated all its upside potential. For new technology a sound cooperation between technicians, project developers, engineers for simulation and banks are very important in order to make such a project feasible from the financing point of view. At the time of writing of the present book, bifacial system has a small market share and the value chain is not yet fully developed: energy yield simulation, demonstration plants and technical descriptions are not yet at a mature stage or no relevant track record exists. In the near future, bifacial PV systems are expected to gain more market share and, with improving track record, the technological risk perceived by banks and rating companies is expected to approach more and more the rating of comparable standard (monofacial) PV systems. The market is moving away from protected schemes like FiT to the common energy market. In the fierce competition, every financial and technical advantage plays an important role. Bifacial PV technology has some very strong advantages. It is sure that this technology will come in focus in the very next years.", "authors": [{"name": "Andre  Richter", "ids": ["50555667"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2018, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4d336d5baa85364acfdeb9caf0b27d76a8e407c6", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "237-265", "doi": "10.1049/PBPO107E_ch7", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1049/PBPO107E_ch7", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2954292708", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Object of this research is the concept of self-production, considered as a humancentered design process held by a designer-maker who, working within a community of artisans or a platform of digital fabrication, manages the entire process, from design, to production, distribution and communication. This research covers a broad spectrum of material that relates to the changing landscape within the design world and beyond, drawing the heterogeneity and complexity of self-production. Diverse approaches developed in the contemporary design scene have been mapped, defining new relationships and highlighting peculiarities, strengths and weaknesses. Linking these diverse approaches is the new role of the designer, who embraces wider areas and acts as catalyst of social innovation, actively involving diverse actors in the design process. Such a figure embodies both the designer\u2019s knowledge and the maker\u2019s know-how, implementing either artisan productions or digital fabrications, shared within a close relationship with craft communities or virtual platforms for Do-It-Yourself. Self-production seems to be not an anachronistic situation, but an interesting opportunity, which addresses the increasing demand for flexible and diversified productions, able to connect local realities with global markets. Such an approach seems to provide young designers with a viable opportunity to start from the bottom, opening up new start-ups on their own to counter the current crisis of the work world. Design can be a key guide for transforming the current scenario into an advanced craftsmanship. It has to rescue its social and economic relevance and foster local innovative initiatives that seek social innovation and sustainable development of a territory.", "authors": [{"name": "Francesco  Mazzarella", "ids": ["32364488"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Rita  Engler", "ids": ["2096862236"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["912e31c7844b95738b63c16ca8641ce6d948dda7", "f5c41e6819a1dc557fd5ba22e6b55895b9eefb6e"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2014, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d607d7ca73cd254b5a3cbe1c053b3a637cc7567d", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2999837499", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

For today, the existence of cooperative formations is justified by centuries of practice, and its objectivity is beyond doubt. However, it is important to streamline the methodological foundations of research, which will ensure the formation and implementation of cooperative policies in the agro-industrial complex in order to improve the efficiency of its functioning. This calls for a deep theoretical rethinking of the essence and significance of cooperation. In the course of research, economic phenomena are viewed not in isolation and from specific historical circumstances, but comprehensively, taking into account specific economic conditions and the real state of the economic, political and social situation in the country. As a result of research, it is justified that \u00abagribusiness\u00bb is such sphere of entrepreneurial activity, the effective development of which is capable of ensuring the welfare of the population, creating conditions for the successful development of other industries. This will contribute to raising the level of economic, and therefore political, security of Ukraine. For the development of cooperation, favorable conditions are necessary, the influence of which on the development level of cooperative relations is expressed in the actions of specific factors. These factors can be systematized, as production, organizational-base, stimulating-legal and stabilizing. In the course of research, it is determined that cooperation in its content is an economic phenomenon, the essence of which is economic relations between partners, on their cooperation for achieving a common goal. This methodological approach to understanding cooperation is important from a practical point of view, since it assumes the creation of an infrastructure, as an indispensable condition for the further successful development of this phenomenon. It is established that the cooperative is a form of cooperation and its organizational structure of an entrepreneurial type, it is created and functions on the basis of cooperative principles that are carriers and regulators of its internal and external relations.", "authors": [{"name": "Fedir  Horbonos", "ids": ["90719434"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Nataliya  Pavlenchyk", "ids": ["88909921"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Anatolii  Pavlenchyk", "ids": ["122780551"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Ruslan  Skrynkovskyy", "ids": ["81086276"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["a8a8176d12efd60a15dee06b0101740bdf89ce51"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2017, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e3fb3cd7680bcaa3e9c460e34b9ccbacb6b73766", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "Technology audit and production reserves", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "14-21", "doi": "10.15587/2312-8372.2018.124670", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.15587/2312-8372.2018.124670", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2801376765", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

It also argues, however, that the key planning question for paratransit should not be how to achieve service coordination and organized planning but rather what institutional factors and frameworks lead to successful paratransit implementation. Three major types of paratransit projects are examined--demand-responsive services, vanpooling, and special-client services--and it is concluded that, in each case, successful implementation has been linked to local community and business factors, individual labor-management agreements, and the involvement of existing service providers and local institutional frameworks. The paper further concludes that increasing federal involvement can significantly increase the cost of paratransit services and reduce the chance for implementation. Thus the federal government is challenged to develop rules and funding criteria that will, by making clear that paratransit is a legitimate competitor for federal funds, effectively accommodate the diversity of existing local governmental structures, political bargaining, and service providers.

A case study is summarised for a fictitious normally unmanned facility, and risk results are presented for three different cases with varying extents of safety systems. The case study results are discussed with respect to the risk levels for personnel for the three cases. Risk tolerance criteria are discussed in general and for unmanned production installations in particular. Also risk reducing evaluations are discussed briefly, in general as well as for unmanned production concepts. Individual and societal risk are discussed, together with some regulatory challenges from the risk management point of view for normally unmanned installations. There are no applicable risk tolerance criteria for unmanned facilities, and the criteria for manned facilities are not suitable. There is a strong need for the authorities to focus on the use of risk tolerance criteria for manned as well as unmanned facilities.", "authors": [{"name": "Jan Erik Vinnem", "ids": ["2066143"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["03246724bf3175b9de52c698edc32a32158dfebc", "c28da6e1a5f97acd07b3c00a52e874ec695b7654"], "outCitations": ["9a0759823d75ae88306d7c1d4de3a69393860cf5", "bc99bf8d167ba13f244f6a3f6d88e2476a488414", "ebc48f53ba7c63af564c94689ac197b1a52a6cb6", "26af83d7c919ede7216f7d848e07dcb4d9008d19", "166a5c133c764e419f099333bae585100cf3a297"], "year": 2021, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/814ed45b987d969c22e64b980e444cbe1d17a115", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "Safety Science", "journalVolume": "134", "journalPages": "105059", "doi": "10.1016/j.ssci.2020.105059", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.105059", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3095190864", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

As budget control is critical, this area was traditionally dealt in public finance law. This is the reason why government procurement was provided in Public Budget and Accounting Law and Local Government Finance Law. However, nowadays government procurement is provided in individual statutes('Act on the contract in which state is party', and 'Act on the contract in which local government is party') separated from Government Budget and Accounting Law and Local Government Finance Law. These enactments were influenced by Korea's joining in WTO Government Procurement Agreement(GPA). Considering the history of these enactments, the Korean government procurement contract needs to be dealt in 'correlation between public finance law and international economic law' context. Though government procurement contracts related statutes are separated from public financial basic laws, these contracts are still used as tools of public finance administration. Therefore, government procurement contract regime can be evaluated as apart of public finance law system. However, government procurement contract law system is different from traditional public finance law system in that it is equipped with various transparency related provisions including contracting type and review system. Considering these aspects of government procurement contracts, public law nature of these transparency-related provisions should be acknowledged, and these provisions should not be deemed to have just internal effect. This point can be evaluated as a positive correlation between public finance law and international economic law. On the other hand, WTO GPA has tendency of restricting the scope of individual countries' discretionary powers in public finance administrations. It especially restricts the industrial or technical policy use of government procurement contract. Guaranteeing the industrial or technical policy use of government procurement to a certain extent is meaningful for economic development of Korea and other developing countries. International economic system which is reorganized to enhance economic development of developing countries will contribute to the expansion of Korea's procurement market in the long-term. To this end, Korean government should make just effort to guarantee discretionary powers in public finance administrations in WTO GPA revision process.", "authors": [{"name": "\uae40\ub300\uc778", "ids": ["66656740"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5fb09b14b18399807f949ba96e6a977c202b98e7", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "1888575353", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

This paper empirically examines the management, delivery and the challenges of polytechnics in Ghana. A cross-section design was used as well as multi-stage sampling technique. In addition, both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collections and analysis were also used. The study showed that the governing council is the highest decision making body of the polytechnics which derives its authority from the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC Law 32. Amended by Parliamentary Act 745 2007) and the rectors are the heads of administration responsible for the efficient utilization of the polytechnic resources. The rectors are supported by the vice rectors, registrars, faculty deans, heads of departments, finance officers, librarian, internal auditors, the planning officers and the students representative council. The study further revealed that all polytechnics operates the semester system and inadequate funding, inadequate staffing, high staff turnover, high enrolment, lack of effective industrial linkages, outdated curriculum delivery and unstable academic environment are some of the challenges the study has found out. Adequate funding by the government, recruitment of qualified lecturers, provision of adequate facilities by the government and revisions of outdated curriculums' can go a long way to make the polytechnics a better place for middle man power training in Ghana and also to meet the target of the Millennium Development Goals.", "authors": [{"name": "Sulemana  Iddrisu", "ids": ["113584223"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Eliasu  Alhassan", "ids": ["80519698"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Tony  Kinder", "ids": ["143635664"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["25166b9b71b25f430a5463671a2a931dcf1a6fd8", "b3b1185314d477e50dbf22a2230f65955cec1d06", "3708085a27f5e95aaab0d5f5689701fdae3a7c1a"], "outCitations": ["daf7213a76f7c3ba0a3450216d68ecad751f6af1", "7c9d88d98cb82d3952a052f24a6b2ca7c4479cd9", "e61cd349edf4f5e48246f7e89172996f6150d338", "729be50e8fd0acf4b055ed9c32ec8e9f0814dd9a", "3aa1f4aa38993cea791705a2c38d599e97156f6f", "c5ba6d8fb00bca79a7dcea06cf411e2c810f7388", "4534100304f3e045604ce9d9ecb2eac9ad3c4e0b", "e06c3bf5f378919a866e5ee65ea1018430dc9cd8", "52e72b01f3710855bd59b2ae1320fc002f675f86"], "year": 2014, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d3ffec64dd2299cfa7128bcdde2b7259f87f019a", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/18424984/Polytechnic_Education_in_Ghana_Management_Delivery_and_Challenges.pdf", "https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18424984/Polytechnic_Education_in_Ghana_Management_Delivery_and_Challenges.pdf", "http://udsspace.uds.edu.gh/bitstream/123456789/1063/1/POLYTECHNIC%20EDUCATION%20IN%20GHANA%20MANAGEMENT%20DELIVERY%20AND%20CHALLENGES.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "The International Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities Invention", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "1503132379", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

{"id": "8247fcd7523052e9fb7a50bdf823a3d350f92e27", "title": "Implications of the growth of dental education in India.", "paperAbstract": "By influencing the supply of trained human resources, the dental education sector can play a significant role in influencing policy goals of ensuring good quality and equitable access to oral health services in developing countries. Our research goal was to assess quantitatively the size of the Indian dental education sector, its growth over time, and the implications of this growth for equity and quality in oral health care. Information on the location of teaching institutions, the year of establishment, type of ownership, and seat capacity was obtained from government sources, the Dental Council of India, and websites of individual institutions to estimate the growth in the undergraduate dental education sector, including the role of the private sector from 1950 to 2005. Data on location of training capacity and institutions were used to assess the geographical distribution of undergraduate dental education capacity in India. Registration data on dentists, the size of available faculty relative to regulatory requirements, and penalties imposed on offending faculty and education institutions were used to assess the impact of the growing Indian dental education sector on graduate quality and equitable access. Dental colleges and enrollment capacity have grown rapidly over the five decades since 1950, mainly due to a growing private sector. There is regional inequality in the location of dental education schools in India with a bias toward economically better-off regions. The growth in the dental education sector has translated into increased overall access, although accompanied by rising inequality in access and possibly lower quality of dental education.", "authors": [{"name": "Ajay S Mahal", "ids": ["2569111"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Naseem  Shah", "ids": ["145474468"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["cc97dc3a4ad35c51d34f5ef7bc4624178bdffffc", "2c75b7d62b9623fd8c792821082f6e3fa40f608c", "1fc292c188a07fdcb689491f117055d0fd6bedbc", "6eca883635f2effcb9d310246e9b372d3c77afc5", "e44522979be1923c9fe1533701e924e3efe23be2", "ee75ede3c44b979ec753d1b2df700d6c04010dae", "3e26f31908fa6ce5ce6dacf1dbdaeff89e477552", "0389a0e9cc949c7e55a8fbc094a6fc51683d1687", "033aeaa904530d284afab91869c66cd84128116d", "8cdf56009baa7ebae2ab0e7357d733142d6f31c7", "3b5c1e4f0c3fdab448b58e835f27556e308eb370", "7cdd0f2c0efadae261976ce88e27a4eea467db89", "8393757a063db53472575ad2e3014187b6820632", "cf3da29f9638660d4e75a3bf349b102c620149b7", "a54df1acde081615c1e1071d453c8f3f8d191d91", "54f19b5be430c847181d2f527d09455b7daff2bd", "471dd719b9f58d6c1e997c670d584684776b127b", "3bba530109c048a4821bd0c64c019058f256674b", "db414cfdbdef1eea454015b3500c7635744ffd44", "be5cf8ac885617c612bcad4b0fc31529559f5fe2", "898f5e1114fc96ede2c3a260bf710adbdb4d9337", "06ee3a640848db24e96e84f0e4738da87d3c26f8", "a14365184ed6aae430aeddd6aef74b9f18a80e44", "835b564397f1a9de0011b073076559cfcb1206a8", "d2c37223cafa1f80138c96ee317f61942039953e", "48ed73da849f8b364d7d163f64c6c9930baa0d38", "c7cbbc479cff43b177be033feb5ce6ee3ddbfad5", "76bf0c44a32913bc7f571f6b4539206d9683a68d", "b93e4f199009b608b5049cfd3e7edbbc6638d3b7", "5fbd7525e3c178b1272e8609a4e2799326a6bd87", "e6df73bf8d1fcc6be7d2f440af221aed53074433", "62aa85363a583200a4ef06cc5639e224d0eef7a7", "4e4eedd79b201f9e9974247690afde3600d0aa3c", "83933a3f39cf0209824b946db05e67b10cc7f041", "f68ad10e7e0028b9d99a2562dba590d2d35fc568", "26bd52385d59ba7bf766572d6f3a5bca14a69a63", "afadea5265d012e7a582fe76b60d0e0a8b767657", "eb0d384e0355e4a5aeb1b26a985790263ded4860", "c63cb17b375300d843bb470919fb65befbede14b", "3c915e62a3519e00ac680183e4de460ea8f0bd6d", "3c7b146391205960d47df1cc76e2238b58eb7658", "ceaf14c4ca8842ead1fc6f66cbe686e451ba5f52", "391f057863af120c1647a8ccb9d004f153d1cbf7", "b4430d5316ab8de98b6bed92c0405bef85827f4a", "fbb10855b44aa6c543242eda2c5181146df71814", "f7a4175815bf7ff8df6f68d6f63d08daca4d744e", "99beba741cbff53f92c33e47c32686dcbc80b1cb", "cb627933a1eb01d37f94bad801afa2c61c51f50b", "136bb508e94b989aec436133409b5ae8040bae31"], "outCitations": ["e69bb1bba32c0ded374cbf23c49bcac5c280d56e", "317fd76636e9e98ee80d2ea8ababcd0d8a2f4f7e", "9eff30a73d07bdf132aecce2329567a9ee2eb7a5", "3e052ecf430c4e6f2d23a826038fb6d6e7cf2c0e", "bd0d67065f767033ae9d10be41653d99332d9cbd", "223c269e452353199978d8c7f197f2c2c058a7f4", "c50ad5ae34728280e06ab004febaec28ef7ef327", "adf17a2e85bae5500ae80f195d122d03b151188e"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8247fcd7523052e9fb7a50bdf823a3d350f92e27", "sources": ["Medline"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.ifdea.org/gkc/jde/Documents/Implications%20of%20the%20Growth%20of%20Dental%20Education%20in%20India.pdf"], "venue": "Journal of dental education", "journalName": "Journal of dental education", "journalVolume": "70 8", "journalPages": "\n          884-91\n        ", "doi": "10.1002/J.0022-0337.2006.70.8.TB04155.X", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1002/J.0022-0337.2006.70.8.TB04155.X", "pmid": "16896091", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business", "Medicine"], "magId": "2403841125", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

The examination is undertaken using quarterly data from 2005-2010. The results shows that some forms of e-payment instruments like debit cards, have negatively affected currency in circulation, while GDP and interest rates are found to exert significant influence on currency demand as expected from the theory. The estimated coefficient of cash-card substitution of 0.15 suggests that a 10% increase in debit cards transactions would result in the reduction of demand for cash transactions of around 1.5%. However, given the low degree of debit card usage for making payments and the slow change in the payment behavior, it is unlikely that this development will have noticeable impact on the future use of cash and the implementation of monetary policy. This suggests that payments by cash continue to be strong at around 8-10% of GDP for foreseeable future. Nevertheless, given the relatively high cost of currency provision and usage, our findings of certain degree of cash-card substitution can provide positive influence on the future reduction of the country\u2019s resource costs in relation to cash usage.", "authors": [{"name": "Rungsun  Hataiseree", "ids": ["118712697"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["41b0fc21d7a17637045c4949ba67eff552cb5df0", "62c9ed962dc52cad928c48ea2b8dae948dd40b05", "23794eb30b326a7effaf6b4a1ea6915c87ee67c9", "b8a325ca4f4954e8e81721267102647b4e24a2bd", "34e2ba2e9983bedb041e3161b61f5c58520edd5c"], "outCitations": ["09bcc3b3f473e6b3e227cdfcdc836781ca19773f", "db4d97c2824900a64fa7dc0b8962fa1a2fd6fd3b", "b598f8c141ac77e075ad4c88c0ec5dca9250d9fe", "4f993d92c3e34602f0aabc4e3048913d4e5e6762", "d2305b979cb24a89d74b7ca7570881f2224dae53", "b121c7b212ffb4097a2c3a3e994086662ae7bf79", "810fd61a547df05d4dc0b55d595432c82af75720", "b87a104708b9a83b15473e006ee6b4726ffea1e0", "b87a95e92d8d5f298437b431aaef3be3943910cd", "c454defb1164fe037dc391f1e5916ab7c049b6fc", "41f57d0af119ac521fcb85e87f7305211e683a3c", "3d598490a54f01596f77679c236983116b1db669", "aa6949717786fa07b9a481b17b6382155cb636d6", "f4a92b6d4f83ba9cbe814e3d1116d76f5c456a1d", "66e85878b984605820ba1c5877c8ab97467501d8", "a70557225e0b7df7a8a9f09639e222f522958100", "07dd8214e77f274171e943877a620570d1196b01"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/047c08f6b632b11d37904ffad034556d598f4c97", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.ecb.eu/home/pdf/research/TheEffectOfEpaymentInstrumentsOnCashUsage.pdf", "http://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/pdf/research/TheEffectOfEpaymentInstrumentsOnCashUsage.pdf", "http://www.ecb.int/home/pdf/research/TheEffectOfEpaymentInstrumentsOnCashUsage.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2906679741", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Changes in consumer behavior are likely to be reflected more quickly in retail sales than in any other type of economic or marketing indicator. Hence, it is vital for economic and marketing purposes to have accurate information on retail sales and on changes in these sales. Despite the importance of retail sales data, little seems to have been done either on examining the bases for the national retail sales estimates or on comparing the two sets of current retail sales estimates with each other. Both of these series are compiled by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, one on a monthly basis and the other on a weekly basis. In addition, these two series are meant to cover the same population over identical periods, albeit with different frequencies. But are they truly comparable for analytical purposes?

This article examines the extent at which the protection of minority shareholders is an objective of EU law, comparing certain provisions in the Takeover Directive with their equivalent in English law. The arguments advanced in this article are threefold. First, English law offers better protection to minority shareholders than accorded under EU law. Second, that the protection accorded to minority shareholders under EU law is only incidental to the objective of facilitating the restructuring of companies. Third, that in seeking to achieve a restructuring of companies objective, both EU law and English law on takeovers trumps property rights of minority shareholders.

An assessment of the implementation of article 5.3 of the World Health Organization framework convention on tobacco control", "paperAbstract": "BackgroundThe World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) stands to significantly reduce tobacco-related mortality by accelerating the introduction of evidence-based tobacco control measures. However, the extent to which States Parties have implemented the Convention varies considerably. Article 5.3 of the FCTC, is intended to insulate policy-making from the tobacco industry\u2019s political influence, and aims to address barriers to strong implementation of the Convention associated with tobacco industry political activity. This paper quantitatively assesses implementation of Article 5.3\u2019s Guidelines for Implementation, evaluates the strength of Parties\u2019 efforts to implement specific recommendations, and explores how different approaches to implementation expose the policy process to continuing industry influence.MethodsWe cross-referenced a broad range of documentary data (including FCTC Party reports and World Bank data on the governance of conflicts of interest in public administration) against Article 5.3 implementation guidelines (n\u2009=\u200924) for 155 Parties, and performed an in-depth thematic analysis to examine the strength of implementation for specific recommendations.ResultsAcross all Parties, 16% of guideline recommendations reviewed have been implemented. Eighty-three percent of Parties that have taken some action under Article 5.3 have introduced less than a third of the guidelines. Most compliance with the guidelines is achieved through pre-existing policy instruments introduced independently of the FCTC, which rarely cover all relevant policy actors and fall short of the guideline recommendations. Measures introduced in response to the FCTC are typically restricted to health ministries and not explicit about third parties acting on behalf of the industry. Parties systematically overlook recommendations that facilitate industry monitoring.ConclusionHighly selective and incomplete implementation of specific guideline recommendations facilitates extensive ongoing opportunities for industry policy influence. Stronger commitment to implementation is required to ensure consistently strong compliance with the FCTC internationally.", "authors": [{"name": "Gary Jonas Fooks", "ids": ["78292357"],

Urban low carbon transitions suggest a substantial re-ordering of urban infrastructure. However, there is a critical need to engage with the material implications of low carbon practices since research so far has painted a picture of incremental ambitions struggling in implementation. This paper interrogates how carbon governance is implemented through urban buildings and energy systems, and the implications for urban decarbonization, by drawing on three urban case studies: Stockholm, London and San Francisco. The analysis draws on interviews with representatives from government, industry, utilities, building owners, and non-governmental organizations who are striving to achieve decarbonization in their cities. Patterns are emerging in what is being made to matter politically through the translation of carbon governance into building-energy infrastructure. In particular, the paper finds that (1) a short-term decision making timeline encourages action that incrementally reduces greenhouse gas emissions without fundamentally overcoming carbon lock-in, (2) actors are harnessing exceptional urban space to overcome the tyranny of cost-effectiveness in maintaining fossil fuel entrenchment (with concerning implications for justice and uneven development), (3) there is a pattern of individualization of responsibility for decarbonization, and (4) material politics are limiting the application of low carbon retrofits for the existing built form. Overall, this paper examines the implementation of urban carbon governance while encompassing the messy, materially embedded, and contested nature of infrastructure transformations.", "authors": [{"name": "Laura  Tozer", "ids": ["51131225"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["18b799bd5a40046035c57debeff10938cda5bda8", "8d086efd13e26bbc5abb90f9c64d415b6adf5ba6", "21e0f5f7450c3e2a5b78bc372251b57497c2c7a6", "9c2fd62ec74f9881c676ea8dccd3cf3ca4f85152", "5920694ef077b055e785705a2a98cec97da93979", "e1535acc1a53034283a555d25e037e8fb27b3381", "61803f15fd7436905c1b4f5799b5717d32fe2990", "7a21d3cfc67465b9ed9306d119402f2a03e0cbf5"], "outCitations": ["8ce9b7c55249a3d9b246e069d88bfbe1da5e0da4", "b0e9ac72044e56676ad8d5f803beb2ba5f47db01", "af85223095291c6a43e35ea5eb1882f49c98edb5", "cc60d31b11bc073320c216b8f158acba0dfddbb9", "bb6782790e226a4395ea3af30032548f007f8f63", "fd948508326509b29be0ea384d89892f3e7751a1", "e4ffaa8aad441c925cadecaaf8a902b456141f6c", "8f868206e5172210e58192eae95d2f82999636f6", "53fe795e52e9b67eb02282d8330736839585ac9d", "18298bfcfcce2e31dc3fdb3d6b2e923cafec4f7f", "2e36ae3177e9dcc2401a98954a3db5d5ea49713a", "a5c1664b18a691a79ceb506fe4e923c134c3642f", "eac2e15ae7094672da80df6f0c506877fe8f3a9f", "2f09770ff2867abd14a84a61316454d22f24dd8f", "d16ba1f797be34d35117df36452dd3ca13f56b6c", "810ed8c820c447512c4e904e3c422e8be532b698", "e1da756cd29e003e8c722bd5dc9ef5ef21a6b3d5", "1c4654b95eabf6926302d020b24655aff50cb05c", "8bdc4ab9280d9cfdba0bf742349120dc7856a295", "12cbe35434bb23635f12b20d9c12280aba6dbab2", "eeb535ed4e474020736a5edb9ff8964aac2a42e6", "c379e9aeeaa1cacad76890a7d2a920c4e25ace19", "232116dc04e9b93f0041f25aa0947b73a374ef71", "ad4e92f1cb185dd691200d40b7d180e622eccb61", "53bf0ab9453a62bfc0cda495c90f012915bdcb02", "dd1f9ab99942b7e5524d3226c255ffb88b6a7c51", "a2a4e5f1c2d10a1ba038a9d4b7dbf8fcbcb3be31", "eb7ad8ab843fe95497f79ad791c4f3cf9f69aa33", "ba61dde85ac0bf8d6278791866cfc6f321e672ab", "01257a99c76d66b7e2e28f1389428e2cc7555e39", "3698f6e94391cab5b5ab4d3fbd671ce91cfddfc3", "1f33ecfef1003db685f3b010d0a6fcdc22d2d284", "69b44ea2bdcab371be65d01baddbc643cb5d4672", "7f53a7812b0f259fe9d0d9f572a90ef86e2b73a0", "ed4115a2345ff64ec4d7cd16243f81f349636744", "9fe646d6d3522354b99025b4ff46cdb42f22d749", "6d5ad013f1e469a8c98a073b401e22380dad035c", "7955615b2bcc7335a20614c833aceec70d8c7b12", "b885302a0718786233f33329eac60c3133b15712", "d9684d1545f16625d0564ffc6608d8337f6b50ba", "b4291e55ead7f1e4cfc8fa9ac7af5daabed07d65", "baffcdf6ea4f81b0b42514bc088553c6f3a2fa88", "abab75a3ec2ed2694d2b36dffff397f1fcb69691", "729ea31ad37483e4544c73cdcffbc379da023246", "d38ed57d5016d28c6927526ed054a18b35097e48"], "year": 2019, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1e86b927cd020f50ecbc77e6532f0336be0acb2b", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "Geoforum", "journalName": "Geoforum", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.1016/J.GEOFORUM.2019.03.020", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GEOFORUM.2019.03.020", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2927938918", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

{"id": "9886d5eadb6f26d23d228cecd0ca8391abfecd6c", "title": "The Relation Between Executive Succession and Corporate Capacity", "paperAbstract": "This study examines the relation between executive succession and corporate capacity. Because corporate capacity is a significant determinant of organizational performance it is an important task to identify its antecedent factors. The study suggests three mechanisms explaining why executive succession is likely to be related to subsequent corporate capacity changes; namely that it for new executives constitutes a means of performance improvement, a signaling device, and a venue for building a power base. It is argued that these mechanisms will relate differently to executive successors with different backgrounds explaining variation in post-succession corporate capacity.

There is some concentration of positive results, which is also dependent on the number and quality of the available target companies.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe evaluations used in this study vary considerably in their design, nature and the input and output variables used and, thus, limit a robust comparison of their outputs. Most of the evaluations examined in this paper did not control for multiple simultaneous treatment effects and/or subsequent funding rounds.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe evaluations are rarely designed to compare the treatment effects of alternative policy choices. Only seldom is an evaluation designed to assess the impact of the scheme in the context of the broader policy mix (with its framework conditions, etc.) which would provide more fine-grained policy implications.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe recent literature (Durufl\u00e9 et al., 2017, Da Rin et al., 2011) highlights the dearth of studies exploring the role of government policies supporting venture and, more broadly, equity investments beyond comparisons of the efficiency of independent venture capital and government-backed venture capital. Most studies explore the impact in terms of exits, initial public offering and leverage effects whereas fewer studies look at output effects on companies such as turnover and employment growth. The paper aims to collect the existing evidence including less analysed policy evaluation studies and draw lessons for public policy.\n", "authors": [{"name": "Katarzyna  Szkuta", "ids": ["101633169"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Blagoy  Stamenov", "ids": ["122583651"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Paul  Cunningham", "ids": ["48826066"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["4cc4ecce842b755432e2c458b2879088af61698e", "cfe722449fad29982015bdbbd0588db6fa0151f2", "2a469eb6148800cd90da7dd15aa5a130319b93fe", "a66007c722c3266a07417c13ba7992937779652a", "003cee6a0a4a3dd484a092516945519dd8098d2f", "38987ad0865a94847397b264f75cd705cca36f6d", "3ec68226c88e13ddc1eef0b2603242619b4abd0a", "90a9907abdbe9ac6211d1db4f745d0c1d676652c", "cdb0258af787c4fc3bb1c54908f17ebc7e50316d", "3e73b47a40c63fa955f0124b77880c77cbf49c5e", "bab0190103eae482746f6c359872024cdf4f247b", "fc1d61f6d1f25ecad0efa1dc75f88ab08e8b3c15", "4460c2cdef3f037614765be09355f52ef3b6739f", "b2c66a87122e7b4914a76c374cc0e8b109ebe14f", "a71218ced44d557d264a8416e916a60ac71a0ba9", "68800e00f2a15114ac13e51d8f75391cf4ec3a1f", "39e60e14eb2e5877e9de31d97ba66a09369c10a2", "1442ea9c063cf4bf6ceaa4b4038fbea71edacabe", "12be9cb6d3256d8366e7d9330d95ae40ac372434", "fa63ede4c6fb43ad5d3673fc94b874752197c546", "335b4e753e869d4d71a474b8a0000342a068f994", "db25637f70f2721d888afa0bae5ba57cfc699042", "7d55d00d50568b9d89e41e99b20f8d5f385c609d", "4f2fe93cef6b1ecc59be0c6650a6c0873daa46db", "829db8108afbad9537e03b69b7984c20e5f21d48", "2b6f5bc27af269d361189eb054d3f5d4ef15c049", "bd0cb3b03dcb52ead513c24008e75fc09a804a8d", "c591ba98075527195410d50c56f83c6c58d9a4d1", "d23c392fe92830fc80f241f0565db3a982fdaf20", "fce9a80a71c37dc9a7a31fc8759aeda56cc5d26d", "aed4b25ce1646988b650e5e563e0df89672fe27e", "bad9ed322748ab7d83efd1dbaedf3b2fa8ccd6ee", "8da39a2b842e430c677c585fc425d3d47a7fe4cb", "8a16c0836d92f5f21cf2c990a5c37d2ae284dc58", "f117fed8fc0dc6566d01afee799792b9b3ed634a", "15468c50ddde7c90dff899d58f5c31d7098bf157", "99f6a067fd1b01d2a56e930371c811874c5100ec", "21521aaed76106448144c97ab5e94c54f1747c64", "400a9abc8a270f7bbbc00c3379c13fed365ca4fc", "5156334c6aa563d32b1a345cfe05c10c6ed2b03c", "4f5e1cebbb0285984c5f2cdc55b98c475f3387c4", "e58e65bdc001e318e92d3d7493a668650d7977ec", "5c1e2d3b45d39b95a80320aa7e49aac2415f83a3", "c34aae44df465eb24625b5554bc0a6ee274d30f7", "96289aecfb5f8aed87268f8303620fe9c0d42a64", "91f8e09f676caef6adab36f4987f94cecff73ab6", "2fa348e54ba16fbaf8bd3d253bcf1826dce130dd", "51b5ee03d310ea6f1f0a22ad0f07dcc9ec72108e", "5b12ad8fb3adaee13f5b5dd99be3a171b37b8f9c", "eb0ca0330858aacf2ccd0babea18bcdd801241bf", "b86a0b5f594fad3072c9ea8a5e76d3d8efb4324d", "2e0f5c0de755ae2155b2ed983843da82d56582ee", "5a23a6aab78662378d561e2f6b03686c1537e353", "3273c63b409e3d494d6f91ca6048178998b48142"], "year": 2020, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cee3a447f54499c74b0192c069c95670a51ac8b0", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "foresight", "journalName": "foresight", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.1108/fs-06-2020-0055", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1108/fs-06-2020-0055", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "3117413473", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

The purpose of this paper is to understand the challenges and changes in the Indian rural credit market in the post-independence period.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nUsing data from the All India Debt and Investment Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation of the Government of India from 1971\u20131972 to 2012 and Reserve Bank of India in 1951\u20131952 and 1961\u20131962, the study focuses on three important aspect of rural credit market, i.e. the availability, sources and uses of credit. The analysis is based on both the national and state level data and uses the decadal growth rates to explain the changes in the rural credit market.\n\n\nFindings\nAvailability of credit, in terms of volume and number of households indebted, has increased substantially. However, the sharp rise in outstanding debt is a matter of concern. The share of credit from institutional agencies has seen a continuous decline post liberalisation. The non-institutional agencies, particularly the professional moneylenders, continue to be the most preferred sources of credit owing to their flexible nature of operation. Interesting, microfinance has emerged as a major source of credit particularly for the poor rural households. The rise in credit usage for non-income generating activities amongst poor households is another important concern.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe study highlights some of the most important features and characteristics associated with the Indian rural credit market. An understanding of these issues would provide valuable insight for shaping the future policy responses.\n", "authors": [{"name": "Sougata  Ray", "ids": ["46999719"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["21ec9cdbf19f2d064b73be7100bf7501eaabc481", "b2d705b7f6ce662858b7a00fd49485baf19b2e98", "43f83303350dbeb418889676befde1ee65d72b86", "04172e2f072236315be8396793061471444c0851", "e2774b96cd759babddf5c2bf9f588fda1ed82ee1", "d9faf4f2feebe1f21ee4fb6ccfcb02023f665209"], "outCitations": ["c6892314b74f6da895d024a76de2727018aa278d", "266ab6276bfa2a96addc694166e86bf5ae6024ee", "683f02a959b5ad06b439354a02cf8cdba2f1836f", "043b544cbbe564e50474feac3bdb6b629247d837", "a89491a33ce20ece9138b207bffde75ed060395a", "74d08f65c9853568caf3df12e8916e0543db31fc", "90ec75b85d9b79b1a34a6542d94dd8343b02009f", "c64f166523fd89b172ae95d71996bbd6c6c640da", "49d15c6a268fd31c2c2d604c5bf534442c77fdb3", "f47ea85139d629d8cb810c9d343a04074050937c", "860a1b728d192974f7eb105e8fc66dbd0efa25ba", "22451e5557ced5b4b8dd00f0f0ed0f8158060f6c", "3700b82f21507a91b540879f0de6a2d431457c3a", "06d816c41062d4124e870b4802a4f1085680778f", "146c3198b4b1b8ccb804bd52f98856c08f683e57", "a38b67c2b4b6f48c5489e91fbc1b2144f1fbd394", "67ce86869c0a197d996a129e5c93878f6bec37e9", "77b99ca0afeb91570da453648941af04feb4513c", "e25b6c8bea0618d7802b846b34dea261168d38f8", "15c5894b81c4f3103ae641b858c625919e8d5e90", "d7e0010c443b9398082fe0ca688080ac5a291a87", "75fa4793a9bd4fd0d467e73825d0f83ab48d8d68", "f05b35b661060553f1359f19287f569042fb31d8", "3f4843d19204cfc32a09b53e3865de40a1d870ec", "9c0812c44cf27851a86180671a2393082ddcd484", "497dbd6cd33842282176d92a4fe0338b572ded07"], "year": 2019, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c09b26c04a7435c54d97ac89809ed8f6f88dbe4d", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "Agricultural Finance Review", "journalName": "Agricultural Finance Review", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.1108/AFR-07-2018-0054", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1108/AFR-07-2018-0054", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2952096017", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Given retailers\u2019 attitude towards the risk associated with the demand uncertainty, the framework optimally considers overage and underage costs, and discount policy to define the contract share and prices. A novel simulation-optimization approach has also been proposed to provide a global optimal solution for the model using the advantages of the linear transportation model. More analytically, the approach leads to some original and meaningful trade-offs among retailers\u2019 and generation companies\u2019 profits, markets share, overage and underage costs, and the all-unit discount given by retailers. By this means, an almost linear, positive relationship is found between the spot market share and the underage cost. On the contrary, retailers\u2019 sensitivity to overage cost is greater if the share of the spot market is low and the retailer is more risk-averse. In this way, the greater the overage cost, the higher the share of the spot market. And, the lower the overage and underage costs, the greater the retailers profit, and the lower the generation companies\u2019 profit due to the lower retailers\u2019 order quantity. The amount of the discount has a negligible effect on retailers\u2019 order quantity, while lowering prices. However, an increase in the amount of the discount has a negligible but negative effect on the spot market share.", "authors": [{"name": "H\u00eari\u015f  Golp\u00eera", "ids": ["2018655"],

It is an instrument affecting employment, social, cultural and economic issues, and also as a component of natures cultures destined to have a great importance in the economies of different countries in the future. The careful determination of supply and demand for microcredit and the increasing role of small businesses to be economically productive and perform services in favor of society, undoubtedly requires a cautious policy in the development of microfinance institutions. Microfinance developed in Albania in the 90s and since then has been a key element in its development and economic environment. It is now a recognized part of the financial markets thanks to the support of donors and the serious involvement of the government. Overall economic development of the country, the creation of new jobs, increase the standard of living, increase social stability, political and economic development of Albania and the region in general, interregional cooperation and integration of Albania into European structures cannot be understood, if we do not develop a human and natural reserves, but this development cannot be done without strong financial support. So what small business financing systems will be developed in the future, what will be the position and its role in the economy, what policies will be pursued funding to balance demand and supply in this market? These and others are the subject of this paper since it is difficult to determine a solid line because microcredit is a growing and variable phenomenon. Without understanding the effects and necessity of economic development of the microfinance market, one cannot understand the essential role of microfinance in the growth and positioning of small business.", "authors": [{"name": "Oltiana  Muharremi", "ids": ["119124912"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Erald  Pelari", "ids": ["118611140"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2012, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f2723089929c0413e2ac610dd57b8740b3502e88", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://knowledgecenter.ubt-uni.net/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1556&context=conference", "https://knowledgecenter.ubt-uni.net/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1556&context=conference&unstamped=1"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.33107/UBT-IC.2012.58", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.33107/UBT-IC.2012.58", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2913797033", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Most major treasury groups accept swaps as asset and liability management tools. Virtually all major financial institutions have teams of swap specialists which deal in swaps as a trading unit and assist in providing sophisticated swap-related financing to the institution's major customers. A number of institutions specialize in the brokerage of swaps. Swaps are thus a central fixture of international finance. This article discusses the often de-emphasized, but nonetheless real, credit risks in swaps, using a hypothetical swapping entity, Party X. The credit risk created by Party X will be analyzed from five perspectives: (i) Party X's counterparty; (ii) Party X itself; (iii) a lender to Party X; (iv) a governmental regulator of Party X's counterparty; and (v) the credit market as a whole. While this article focuses primarily on swaps, much of the substantive discussion is also applicable to many derivative products such as caps, floors, options, futures, and other instruments that may involve bilateral obligations.2", "authors": [{"name": "Schuyler K.

The definition of competitiveness has become one of the key definitions in the formation of the regional development strategy. For manage the development of the region is recommended to use a project-based approach. At this, the important processes are the processes of formation of a portfolio of projects and determination of their priorities. The peculiarity of regional development projects is that they are aimed at satisfying a large number of different stakeholder groups. Each stakeholder group has its own view of the results of development projects. Providing homeostasis between the stakeholders of regional development projects is a hard job. Because projects demand are formed based on quality indicators. Constantly changing list of quantitative indicators is used to describe the quality indicators. In addition, the indicators themselves change their planned value and their importance in the framework of a quality indicator. Considering limited budget of regional development it is necessary to form a portfolio of projects that will ensure maximum stakeholder requirements. In this regard, the tools of formation and prioritize of regional development projects are proposed to build on the basis of a homeostatic approach. This approach allows to build a complex management system aimed at the survival of the object of manage in an aggressive environment.

Most migration theories continue to emphasise migrants and their actions as a key to understanding processes of movement (Koser and Salt, 1997). In fact, international labour migration may be conceptualised as a business, populated by a range of institutions each of which has some influence on the processes, patterns and outcomes of movement. These institutions include employers and trades unions, government, universities, regulatory bodies, migrant organisations and facilitators such as lawyers.

A major area where an international accounting standard has not gained universal acceptance is that of financial instruments. The European Union's refusal to adopt all of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, highlights that fact. The International Accounting Standards Board continues to address financial instruments in efforts to remedy this situation. Thus, it is important to better understand issues affecting the development of an international financial instruments accounting standard. The purpose of this study is to find out what issues are important to respondents in their comment letters regarding the Financial Instruments Discussion Paper (FIDP), and whether stakeholder groups differ in positions and the reasons given to support their views. The FIDP represented a major step toward approval of IAS 39 and proposed fair value accounting for all financial instruments. Over 1500 pages of comment letters were generated by the 168 respondents, who represented over 20 countries and several different stakeholder groups. While most respondents disagreed with the FIDP, differences in support and the specific issues used to support those positions were found by stakeholder interest group (accounting profession, regulators, standard-setters, financial analysts, and preparers) and by stakeholder nationality.", "authors": [{"name": "Michael D.

This paper considers some of the important policy and contextual developments in the UK over the last 20\u00a0years and how these may have shaped NICE\u2019s approach to economic evaluation. It then assesses key areas of NICE methods, including perspective, defining benefits, modelling and uncertainty. The paper concludes that NICE has provided important support for the development of new methods, in particular through its role in identifying priorities for methods research funding and its sponsorship of the NICE Decision Support Unit. However, potentially important developments in methods in a number of important areas have yet to be formally included in NICE\u2019s methods guidance and this should be addressed in the Institute\u2019s 2019/2020 methods review.", "authors": [{"name": "Mark  Sculpher", "ids": ["3783375"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Stephen  Palmer", "ids": ["152367530"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["33fa70ea1accbef2a67791d2d1da5eddbc267453", "fb7d2adb5978f378a8aaaed99a215b79a9092afd", "eb2adf3f05da1003a0fcdc38c728a364f4e3cfc4", "cd3917280a4ce9ebcb5dbb471b08ca78fc5d3a71", "66a079afc31c1923333721163fa514aa72ad2011", "af39cb26daaf8bacf56430c52ecf0789bbc25946", "15132084dc379b61adff993961bf0c5db5c5896f", "2a1022b2c4d265337a1d6e9e1d7446d463eee167", "452fd60042227e3efde2daafd1bd8dbdefecd54d", "ae85b6a86991fc8578eb80183d68a14b1367d7a1", "1f0e0447cbdafa3bb8b4b15a7a8086fab711f114"], "outCitations": ["a7250521a0a325ce185db6d31630c5711ef36ad8", "b4d5c16e206eb5204e490ca704d6905da73a7f0c", "c277440b8747b6ebd0bd7def3fbb4b175a9af7e1", "c646229a10912a36d38a0602a19c976e1b7dbfb2", "f60afe9149e84530655dff10d5bc50acbb2475e8", "28ff3c92a83a7ce0a5328554fe47b6667077e2c8", "54676b668ced32cfdcd6c511a6bdc3c7b556c38c", "c6b5457cc512c01a117c74836ec25429984903dd", "89ff5fdbf74c386b690df565484709cdbef0e490", "8c6c85ff1faecb0ad59fe1892497eb22da1b4d93", "0eb4767193ca6b54abacd74986d0634dd9b81e7a", "6fc2e58fdabbe4389cad255aa990b8b99e4120f1", "929fc2decb097728f1aff6b1d10ace4f539afd9f", "de5e42ecba8e966e214303adb1ce7536d974d516", "24412c21b4ea27fb89a1bc8f56ba1977910a61cb", "cd3388a8e8d1ecad1b7f34df5927482d1fbe8f63", "9c1ff39d631b3e8e8639d8d6b1a0c2a34c547048", "b3af00deac49035f402e310894281f3b540600c4", "476d78f3b262d7d0401664a2f63895d23303fbf7", "1aa92c916f511814c19daaefb44e36eded57d704", "e058967188724e4d13a27160e27d8a703663e447", "78a48248415e44539387da7c487a2e798f7b0986", "1f1e1163d47a39cf173d748b714516f11603b70a", "2b1a6fbb3f436435b5a31a197f3c41e6bfdd0b07", "63e1838cb63d0bcbd7ae2e7d83d0230a6a2b590b", "8e7813c08e56776555e29258249adfdabb277f52", "1e4bad9d04f85fc113c0faa9f8e52edbfcc33ac5", "c1c5bba1de04e2e5ef9c062ab41ae2fed78c15f0", "4b6d51e32e02ff3eacea956cb66ac860bb57c34c", "f5aba7f6f45b89493a472740fb05ebccf2102465", "a282ad8fe2b011becd41afddf18402ce969f2f1b", "0c4b914659409886c9e51f39b0ee708f2763cf3c", "b6c03ca99d2ca2a7f6aea4b1e4ab8d3a29a78bb0", "24c964a6a9925138c413ec681eab6f0ac83729ed", "8272a47784f7b86208e4143e40b892435084365d", "22a399ac7324e3d4169f6a279ff6f6e32efa03a9", "c79d583a333dc8db910d839ac72f469c6054a1d1", "7108818edadf03613a4ccaf5e05164ffbf568c4d", "eafb213b91545585c2f8c0ad16158ad541179820", "5f1309d6caf27382eb8864e5f8b178d933884d7f", "8a587f0c45fd751e0f9ba19a663937dd7121a870", "2626913cc7fadb89f3bb5fdd6f361ce281f826ba", "24157c12bb73cf140b5499429e45635f748f30fe", "c416071f485c1d220792c56682cd09a5443eced1", "1f04517f158394bc059d6aea46e5cc35aa64d84c", "851264f52fad66d09a5bf50d12ff8ce0124668c3", "d63fcb925b060690ca2dec7a6c105285dd2d83e9", "ebb1223e16d516bcd9966e9fb35b757258b15d56", "ae40fefe872c034cdd20284d67f5a87c0fded776", "b149d4dbf2083aeb63dcbb895b1d33043a334496"], "year": 2020, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8f5165e0e123c13cb4b3b34a7128b6247d174206", "sources": ["Medline"], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "PharmacoEconomics", "journalName": "PharmacoEconomics", "journalVolume": "38", "journalPages": "247-257", "doi": "10.1007/s40273-019-00882-6", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-019-00882-6", "pmid": "31930460", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business", "Medicine"], "magId": "2999140647", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

This Sharia pawnshop uses a gold buy and deposit system, Gold sold by the pawnshop is a non-real form of gold, so when buying gold the customer does not immediately get the gold, in this case the customer only sees the value of savings through the account balance on the gold savings account, while gold only known in the form of its value because the physical gold has not been handed over until the price is paid in full and the gold is deposited at PT. Sharia Pawnshop. Based on the description of the background of the problem above, the formulation of the problem that the writer took is: How to Determine the price, the cost of safekeeping and transaction costs on buying and selling gold non-cash at PT. KCP Darussalam Sharia Pawnshop? What are the consequences for the parties in a conditional gold purchase transaction? and How is the validity of buying and selling gold in gold savings products at PT. Pegadaian Syariah KCP Darussalam in the perspective of the contract of Ba'i al-muqayyad ?. To answer this problem, the research method used is a qualitative method that focuses on collecting documentation data, to perfect the documentation data the author also requires interview data. After conducting an in-depth analysis of the focus of the research the author can conclude. Seen from the perspective of the contract of al-muqayyad, buying and selling gold in gold savings products at PT. The KCP Darussalam Sharia Pawnshop is formally valid, because buying and selling is tied to certain conditions such as safekeeping according to Islamic law, in the Hanafiyah school of thought the requirements are those that are in line with the purpose of the transaction. Sasabah gold savings cannot take the gold before the gold installments are sufficient, then the gold must be deposited with the Islamic Pawnshop. However, in essence no gold is stored in all PT. Sharia pawnshop where customers make transactions, if customers want to take gold, gold must be ordered to PT. Antam first \u00b1 for a week, then customers are charged a maintenance fee of Rp. 30,000 per year for gold custody that was not actually carried out by PT. Sharia Pawnshop.

This study examines the integrity situation of public services. 64% of the institutions which responded provide public services. According to the results of the research, the provision of chargeable services, the possibility of exercising equity and the excess demand for the services carry significant integrity risks. Integrity is supported by the fact that in the case of cash benefit, an official handover document is usually drawn up and the majority of the institutions appropriately regulate the issue of conflict of interest. However, only one third of the institutions has established a system for supporting complaints and whistleblowing. In addition, particularly in case of organisations where demand permanently exceeds supply, the inappropriate regulation of the acceptance of gifts, invitations and travels draws the attention to a major deficiency within public sector integrity.", "authors": [{"name": "Erzs\u00e9bet  N\u00e9meth", "ids": ["145304203"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Bettina  Martus", "ids": ["100932690"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "B\u00e1lint Tam\u00e1s Vargha", "ids": ["123633202"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["96eb9e18ff19c652135587cdc9e8dd5ff5c69359"], "outCitations": [], "year": 2018, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a471e4ef820ac3932e66cdc11aef52e622033f31", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "Public Finance Quarterly", "journalVolume": "63", "journalPages": "155-175", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2901679167", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

It is crucial that every healthcare provider, both civilian and military, on either side of the conflict become aware of the unique and inherent protections afforded to them under International Humanitarian Law. However, these protections come with obligations. Whereas Governments must guarantee these protections, when violated, medical providers have equal duty and obligations under the Law to ensure that they will neither commit nor assist in these violations nor take part in any act of hostility. Healthcare providers must not allow any inhuman or degrading treatment of which they are aware and must report such actions to the appropriate authorities. Failure to do so leads to risks of moral, ethical and legal consequences as well as penalties for their actions and inactions. There must be immediate recognition by all parties of the neutrality of health care workers and their rights and responsibilities to care for any sick and injured patient, regardless of their nationality, race, religion, or political point of view.", "authors": [{"name": "Frederick M.

Little knowledge exists on the difference in innovation behavior of men and women leading SMEs in transition countries. Using the firm-level data from 30 countries in transition that took part in the 5th Wave of BEEPS survey (2013), this paper estimates whether there is a gender gap in the innovation actions of the SMEs leaders. The results show that the propensity to innovate is higher among female owners, and this finding preserves for four different measures of innovativeness. Thus, female involvement in business might be beneficial for the innovative and sustainable development of an economy. Estimation of the gap in efficiency of implemented innovations did not reveal any strong prevailing gender in terms of effectiveness, and it depends on the type of proxy for innovativeness as well as an indicator of SME\u2019s performance.", "authors": [{"name": "Maryia  Akulava", "ids": ["119281226"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2019, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aa0591f813b625ec7299a008efed69bf396cd8b4", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "Central Asian Review of Economics & Policy", "journalName": "Central Asian Review of Economics & Policy", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.15604/carep.2019.01.03.004", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.15604/carep.2019.01.03.004", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2980682739", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

After reviewing the nature of these claims and the debate about the relationship between first-line management and supervision, evidence is presented from a survey of 135 organizations in London and the South East on how the role of FLM is presently defined and how it has changed. The findings paint a picture of a stable, consistent FLM role where a common performance-oriented supervisory core is surrounded by a penumbra of additional managerial responsibilities relating to stewardship, translating strategy into operations, unit management and, exceptionally, business management. The FLM role remains part of a hierarchical system of individual managerial responsibility and vertical accountability, with narrow spans of control, vertical and internal contacts and authority, participation in decisions and accountability confined largely to operating routines. Changes to the FLM role have been as much towards a strengthening of the supervisory core as a broadening into business management responsibilities. It is argued that the persistence and prevalence of the supervisory core stems from the continued location of FLMs within systems of external, hierarchical supervision. Far from being weakened, the supervisory core of the FLM role has often been strengthened by the adoption of more stringent controls over work practice in order to cope with a growth in business activity or comply with a greater range of external regulations. In some cases, however, a re-division of managerial labour has led to formerly middle management responsibilities and accountability being added to the supervisory core to produce an extended FLM role.", "authors": [{"name": "Colin  Hales", "ids": ["145868174"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["d0483107942f32a11690a33974d0bc08d43dc285", "c2e4d47cecb8a359df45123d3948caa172e6e813",

Recently, the growth of digital marketing and new forms of customer data have disrupted many traditional aspects of marketing practice. Companies are increasingly able to collect data directly from their customers, via large technology firms or from specialist data providers. This has reduced the demand for the traditional fieldwork-based data collection that remains a core focus within the market research curricula. This article considers the past, present, and future role of market research education in the light of the changing practitioner environment. An audit of market research courses is carried out, weaknesses identified, and suggestions made to better align market research courses with evolving skills requirements. More broadly, the article challenges educators to evaluate the extent to which the marketing curriculum can respond to the disruptions brought by the emerging digital economy.", "authors": [{"name": "Daniel  Nunan", "ids": ["13881028"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "MariaLaura  Di Domenico", "ids": ["147450211"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["07bebd589157ec2b015122c23369a2daa14bf36f", "70cdf7fff3bbad85a863e2aca9f7bc4e8f986690", "dccac771f0b37c09aced6080ea8b161dfb549f58", "55c72b7dac0e6becb300a9d732131c77cbc5053e", "f0a709d9bb173738a90daaf51236410fbf0f1e2f", "61189f0b57408be53d3a3029de357838f8d11a27", "98d9eac7536642ecd26e3ed522122508b0f542b8", "8e4eabbbd2c29eab91ecbb8f83f0a34f2122615e", "68cb8154ea7371658c8412c5f355b83579b3a926", "5f58b87aef67526cd7b201733eefdf0f1bf2d613", "60fef8f08e32fd072274dffccc9587dd551b578b"], "outCitations": ["245b57a4c6c991b2ac86440fad13b47d3ba48224", "8ae56a4f8a2095aa741f83279224116660f8548d", "6b11e3e8a08655bef7a5f40d15e16d1947a28713", "a3b203a444255d35ae1ac1ed67984ed3d80e5716", "375396f3fddb6ccf7701060e705b6135cbda2ac8", "4e6bba65f7636a655c778a3e54cc58e148468963", "00ccfa61f6aeccf6d77505b31be57279630aa8a4", "a55076c6ea9906528728ad76a97870d3fa43d5b8", "06e1d627800110c195785a1d9ed3d9e31d1ac9e1", "9622f727f80d5cc309ee7930933dac784118bc65", "ee19c87025998edb0314d5e16d296898987932ee", "afafe50b0288411bb28131aa8737a9aba364d8b8", "c6ebfd32b615b377788e1029e6415d5d1a34af22", "dc4bf3f59d2ef5a495b23abadec7ec285f99c027", "9708f8d279aab517be34770ccaf9f96ad504412e", "dde549262b9ad96c26c4dadbeae7032165734b7d", "1e821f7039769ad3d55f25883828aa7f47c62993", "bce3281388ece76960ed7b6acd203918fee4c854", "75e889ba7ba6d8e6cfef1d602e1099ecab2870ae", "63082639682ec6b5a0d197ab0c8ab071f1091fdf", "708feda44365b64c8024a4068e6331996529e0bd", "17634314dc95cd464d4c20c3536202b836d5805a", "376b1954e685794e463c78a8ce36b84f61d21d48", "b939ddd9b70f19b7c7574460fdf03b0c762f7f82", "e5edebbbd3f0d26816aee6dd25a20f2b01592f13", "91b63db746becca15090963a8990dfe2b5103799", "687cad4573ad3b90020841debff74b1219a0faf3", "70eba2ddd106bf0c75113261caecaa8b93c50a20", "570b3cd536d91762a886f9ab648a78d8061870e9", "9a9a8879e9c6897292ccf3f491c733b55b01e7fb", "82f27d2b810312dda69c145eeeac6397c58b77c0", "ed05ce6da680310167318808b556146f507e6c5a"], "year": 2018, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0f4be5052e6c57d88cdda56edade905911418412", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "International Journal of Market Research", "journalName": "International Journal of Market Research", "journalVolume": "61", "journalPages": "22 - 32", "doi": "10.1177/1470785318805294", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1470785318805294", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2897044325", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

In fact, as noted by Burkle, the modification of operationalizing public health skills for each specific setting is an important factor determining the success of the public health manipulation. Nevertheless, for the control of epidemics, including the present 2014 Ebola crisis, consideration of international collaboration is not any less important. International collaboration, based on cross-cultural agreement, to screen and control the disease is a vital process in the present-day crisis. In some situations, a local public health agency might have to deal with possible importation from other countries. This can be problematic if there is not adequate knowledge of the virus.

After going deeply into debt following the 2005 hurricane season, pricing in the program has been the subject of debate and two reform bills. Private sector insurance pricing has often been used as a benchmark in these discussions. In this paper, we explain NFIP pricing in the context of actuarial pricing principles, clarify why some polices are priced below what is considered to be the full risk rate, and explain how and, more importantly, why NFIP pricing practices differ from the private sector. NFIP pricing has incorporated other program goals that are at times at odds with the ability to cover all payouts for insured losses without taxpayer support. These multiple programmatic goals make the private sector a questionable analog for the NFIP.", "authors": [{"name": "Carolyn  Kousky", "ids": ["3729555"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Leonard  Shabman", "ids": ["5974399"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["a995f0e3a8f2d73646899f4d45563cde5eb5ff79", "ce2b92cb81ca72016c2c76736d88038158223266", "cf9e3987df6b77448ebc5207c97fa64b8952175f", "92f2a0367c101a726c2870b9df5393c488fd0d16", "10245376d937c21c52fe4574e3abc424ca8775a0", "6504b68b5497e24b3e21308ab7f8377aea0a9fc2", "1ce561c41166c42ca0b8f3d633cf5d475b188ea0", "ee7ecf7dfcc2adb55964c68031051146a691d911", "821f101e240a7641c26334deaddefdc29696bfa4", "ce814a9dbf86f7b1fde3482189cb154276f778ac", "db25360d525114ab063e07f391174d51b4ac67bb", "8e8ef2638c3e739fd76be6227514660f23c40747", "85c1d8c948f15fa5b642b4d9ff79da314cb913f2", "1c91b83ebe2cbff652364e1c78efdead23b012b7", "90744c7d59402769e411b0ea04cd4fe802cbb5ee", "4092af11584a4d54b8080e5ef75e788700a7a6d1", "bc41a242a0b12da1f03bcd26994188eb25258a72", "c1ed15f94995fe8345f9cea4f1601816ef778759", "90fcace055253e3a44b1632e1c11a58f3a279af5", "137a7e5c33292e7b6b954b5bef5777ccbaf116b9", "261fe53210cbc791a1994b7838aa6a3483fe7915", "49502dba7e77abb36fc21b28d5c4db1818c715a0", "e805e92b7a0a38bc0577a1c7b3d57a6565e24c52", "99a193cc22f76dda93e698061a6960e443027b9e", "c5f2a600d3f696e7e3e9a617a9a643f60c368160", "0797bb2ed394436a653f560323575f3f6e12b8be", "a63cb68120de6f39d011c706d4c37261b24c881c"], "outCitations": ["7e1b3da86067946f6d30bc10fb0fa22e9060c7d0", "60bd9f9bcc14337d05661e1dd0324bea9e08c601", "2398d1ed6f58143e948ee2335285e000b34b15fa", "8e9815585cc8c255f101d854c67d72d548ee26ca", "8cf8ae774be8245ada107a71e0b0c0f994882d35", "329f6c363b10737d5fce8f8bb8a736d45b373400"], "year": 2014, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b60a118ef95ab3b8d1b63b5fdccd3b9975fc9343", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.rff.org/files/sharepoint/WorkImages/Download/RFF-DP-14-37.pdf", "http://www.docum-enter.com/get/5JJP4z0qjKoaYrghA602K7NO6CKq0y_JYyratXzjBcc", "http://www.rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-DP-14-37.pdf", "http://www.docum-enter.com/get/x9SbaldqYVbSfIj1VyevVDVE7QQc4SJ_b8Xzx8ii7W0", "/Pricing-Flood-Insurance-Resources-for-the-Future.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "Property", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2537915", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2537915", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "420797360", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Innovation is not restricted only the development of tangible products; however, for game software industry innovation also includes the development and the design of game software products, the introduction of game production management. Innovation has brought an uniqueness for enterprises and this uniqueness could be a significant factor of creating competitive advantage. For game software producers nowadays, maintaining competence by simply developing new game does no longer exist. Firms found out that simply producing new games and enhancing high quality screen are no longer key factors to maintain competence. Only by constant innovation enterprises can increase advantages and raise profit. Patent represents the technology capability type and advantages of an enterprise. Though patent analysis, a firm is able to understand the technical expertise of each company and investigate the technical development track and enterprise arrangement of a specific industry. The more patent firms hold, the greater positive of competence they own. This study is based on a general approved patent indicator and we take patent application, the location of publication and gain into considerations.

This paper investigates by means of a scenario analysis which conditions have to be fulfilled for a successful introduction in the city of Amsterdam. First, a short introduction to Amsterdam is given, followed by an outline of the potential of and the problems inherent in the introduction of electric cars. Next, four scenarios are constructed by means of the so-called Spider-model. This model has four major policy dimensions. It is visualized by a picture which consists of four quadrants and eight axes on which important future developments are sketched on a five point scale. The four quadrants represent policy concerns about the (inter)national flanking policies, local economic developments, local spatial policies and public transport policies, respectively. Four scenarios are next constructed: \u2018Prosperous Amsterdam\u2019, \u2018Sustainable Amsterdam\u2019, \u2018Pauperized Amsterdam\u2019 and \u2018Lonely Amsterdam\u2019. These scenarios differ largely in economic developments and in the local and (inter)national focus on sustainability issues. Finally, the transport system and the potential role of the electric car in each scenario is investigated. It is concluded that flanking policies at both the (inter)national and local level as well as a positive economic development are a sine qua non for a successful introduction and adoption of the electric car. When these conditions are fulfilled, the electric car may decisively contribute to the achievement of a more environmental friendly urban transport-system.", "authors": [{"name": "Sytze A.

The aim of this study was to conduct a cross-sectional survey of plant-based non-dairy beverages from three different continents (USA, Australia, and Western Europe) to assess their nutritional content and health profile. A total of 148 non-dairy beverages were analyzed from the nutrition label and ingredients listed on the commercial package or from the information located on the website of the manufacturer or retailer. The different types of beverages were extracts of nuts or seeds (n = 49), grains (n = 38), legumes (n = 36), coconut (n = 10), and mixed blends (n = 15). On average, the plant-based beverages generally scored well in terms of not containing high levels of sodium, saturated fat, or calories.

One of the main means of protecting the operator during overturning is ROPS system. In accordance with GOST (National State Standard), a performance check of ROPS protective structures is carried out on basis of full-scale tests. The purpose of the presented study is to develop the experimental procedure and to obtain the performance check result of ROPS protective device of the tractor unit\u2019s cabin using B10 bulldozer manufactured by the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant as an example. The tests were carried out at the Ural Test Center NATI. For this purpose, a special bedplate was used, allowing to test the protective cabins of tractors with the total mass of up to 110 tons. The hydraulic system of the bedplate allowed to carry out the process of lateral loading of ROPS step by step, where each step corresponded to the 10 mm structure deformation. The applied load and structure deformation were recorded at each step. The energy accumulated by the structure was calculated as the area under the stress-strain curve. The energy U = 40867 J, which was required according to GOST, was accumulated during lateral deformation \uf044 = 270 mm. The force constituted Fy = 243 kN. After removing the lateral load, the structure was subjected to the vertical static and longitudinal loading. During the whole experiment of ROPS protective device, repairs, deformation corrections and adjustments were not allowed. The test results of ROPS structure of B10 bulldozer cabin showed compliance with the GOST safety requirements. During ROPS deformation, penetration of the protective structure elements into the driver\u2019s limited zone was not observed.", "authors": [{"name": "Irina  Troyanovskaya", "ids": ["98663886"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Anton  Kalugin", "ids": ["133612509"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2018, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7a00a0ce542a602ef00c959d94ff1be5fad10195", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["https://www.matec-conferences.org/articles/matecconf/pdf/2018/83/matecconf_icmtmte2018_02061.pdf"], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "224", "journalPages": "02061", "doi": "10.1051/MATECCONF/201822402061", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1051/MATECCONF%2F201822402061", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2898763384", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Using panel data for 33 provinces in Indonesia during the 2007-2013 period, we find that lending to MSMEs reduces income inequality while businesses loans, either for working capital or investment purposes, but also consumer loans increase income inequality.

The nonhomogeneous continent faces local contextual complexities that require locally relevant and culturally appropriate COVID-19 interventions. This paper examines demographic, economic, political, health, and socio-cultural differentials in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The health systems need to be strengthened through extending the health workforce by mobilizing and engaging the diaspora, and implementing the International Health Regulations (2005) core capacities. In the absence of adequate social protection and welfare programs targeting the poor during the pandemic, sub-Saharan African countries need to put in place flexible but effective policies and legislation approaches that harness and formalise the informal trade and remove supply chain barriers. This could include strengthening cross-border trade facilities such as adequate pro-poor, gender-sensitive, and streamlined cross-border customs, tax regimes, and information flow. The emphasis should be on cross-border infrastructure that not only facilitates trade through efficient border administration but can also effectively manage cross-border health threats. There is an urgent need to strengthen social protection systems to make them responsive to crises, and embed them within human rights-based approaches to better support vulnerable populations and enact health and social security benefits. The COVI-19 response needs to adhere to the well-established \u2018do no harm\u2019 principle to prevent further damage or suffering as a result of the pandemic and examined through local lenses to inform peace-building initiatives that may yield long-term gains in the post-COVID-19 recovery efforts.", "authors": [{"name": "Andre  Renzaho", "ids": ["145550427"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["9861d1e6aa4f3aa164ed99853fcb88db0816c9d5", "6c8d2cf0c89af6df655281c5277dde85b092b474", "ce62a42ac0f7fcb0dc02953c38d136a4e2904921", "0088ac44b423d2c01ca049247a5d37b428c925a6", "0548aa0e7a3ab6ff44e083863af9d51dff6e7aee", "d7d736be06b33cd0e2cc6480455520920eda5696", "8908a2f5fe3fcdd0e8c3171af82fa9390ac3b2fa", "ae2ad7e0d2ec5ca6f4a77c56dd33ccf2d1528c56", "6c2c96b0c17cf9c6937f1d9f30bfc7a8fbcaebe8", "e9edd8830df0c86ad7e3a7ff0d3a6b04229fc702", "376183d8b3031534446cf19f898f93b32c42a0ce", "0526c5c63e42e814c0fdede87db437c1a748c823", "96d74f0c5b362a19ab2b7e6b44e07e13b8d70d83", "e77aabd2c4b20e9807e890cee5dd3124c1c0a58a", "9927399f3bdf497db6d14556a6feff776709ca53", "f852a1a7e577eaef6586a2ba921de764b245212b", "107cb55077246ea7477b90b762219624e1b90413", "0b260faf2f1163009e2e2d504867c25f1fa2350e", "7532e0db76f3f29a9c2ff45a625e7a01c3fca7d4", "6eacfb8fbd9189e426ddf3733081260b554da141", "56b5ec050101cfb232e32fe0fdbce49d42d895df", "9f5e87524e42b6c5e9337f645969bd2b8f58d6ef", "c311f7df17795ab9b3ef78ed665cdbfe237552b8", "3960bab8e16b324c76646c3c36497ce2659a33d7", "d8707f6f2f8f26e19ca02c2bcfebbeb0fe0571b0", "9b405fe7ed289d66aa393bc1f317ee31cac0e406", "f87ae81d50ba97ca26e9a66d9fbc919a8b2a09b1", "2e8707d3c6aa836e1d288d928878a66fef9221e1", "e3a16356555adf4469103aaf59e498714feda29a", "f041926f605a50b7123ce272ffe8483bccc22a87", "6de0a45cdaef2af8af5d4df21e055c7f2db899b2", "6182eabb81a0c34e198f2c1d697f1535f9c550b7", "7a68b1584b0a3301dd11227ec2dd608edfba77aa", "18ce401bd7d7cbabbef434381c2502683fd2b78c", "f3cc21ba28b54767f14fe296b72c7488adce1bcb", "dcc5883da61889334f335f11845529dced174f46", "2551fc732bbb99857ab49817200a84279c3c5ccf", "859c32d5b2284599e9d51629a585f111a6f91f52", "51cdad85b0591d129744907b0aed3cd72de194ae", "c493ab99b3235c8d8afd9602cc29fd1a4b68a69b", "add8830079d3b159d95aae54571a21b47ede1fba", "112ada6dcc8812157b51d50da64ce8df8fc28b95", "22b1181b80a92d44afb76e11ccb0e4544ca5b52f", "1f32e84409f7292a7f6a246ec7384af3338d6008", "c3b42edaa2046549525134eddef7390cbd3d8f37"], "outCitations": ["ce9635c7d6fabda531e102ef0403bdda9e5b6a1c", "131b1cef128a6042e7055c60c5038daab3920a72", "a8445060c3d4254d6c86e88790c25bdb38989d33", "8f58fe12e1d26d4dd048af66fc791ee8f69de5d8", "58c20b420da91caeb39476f42d2235e439668a4d", "230cec9787df8c6401435ffa92322ad108316920", "80b4fdc1bf7b944606b6a92c08ba9c80b960622d", "2f54aae9bba102dd572ffd74fe0a88d0c93cd5ac", "74baa482518bc9648a0e4cbe3d92e656c93d1b50", "4734f16c7772cdcb68df84d72bf0c80bcdc76a5d", "ef7b8315ba0cdaf079b0124d82952a0bf8bbd108", "a47e1847bcc3866e71f9beadd9276d65caff2493", "3611cc2c45729465249adb3986a8c7a6d044e3bd", "6d1dbf78844956f8564817882d266ae4e6285756", "bd9861fcbb27924c9adcc0b239c3dce847d33909", "e1890582b5e45df812d4bffac848ffda98a495e1", "45032bfe314519f750c1ee59372ecb6d6855626d", "48fb38641698e95e3e012e2770da397a71ccd163", "4933eaeb7a03487c02c3d7f9afcb5c3cd0035d5c", "98ad3a18a7f87f18759a245d0f2de58073fa2ce8", "d483fb3957a598b50803a29addc95f51e80878f5", "996d22439eeca56f1e87813fc991c822c63097f0", "f6e54aa049aae30b4f767987042779d60e881a9a", "3f69a7f1ea36c506e264a4dd0a5833eab5d375af", "4319bc7f4449c010cffd4402efe74a856ebdb8e3", "409e07e7c90174c9e9c110e5a39d5c883a6fedcf", "160049c9869bd738048dd5e83cd58faca81f950c", "8ec372b4c94fdd87956418e4a46634e3e7203c15", "4303f8eef09e02beeb5126af832bcd764c5733c0", "b3a0287df97c027ddbee58575e8bc6e3112f2efb", "9f2aa992ee55da4f10dd28cc60f80f1bdf08a415", "0a1a37c17d8eac603d83b80e46f0d8b8f2833b5c", "e34e3ffae083e7bc4a9336f3aa88026f7d296e87"], "year": 2020, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0a977e97fae0f7c1ad52b368cce29af6f706fb79", "sources": ["Medline"], "pdfUrls": ["https://researchdirect.westernsydney.edu.au/islandora/object/uws:55967/datastream/PDF/download/citation.pdf"], "venue": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "journalName": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "journalVolume": "17", "journalPages": "", "doi": "10.3390/ijerph17103445", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17103445", "pmid": "32429123", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business", "Medicine"], "magId": "3025083866", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Though introduced very late in the chain of materials, polymers occupy a major place and pivotal position in our materials map today. Unfolding of the science of polymers and polymer \u2013 based materials had evoked lot of interest and made them as a class of materials for their potential use in the field of \npharmaceuticals and industry based products. In recent years, an awareness and understanding of these polymers has increased based upon the following factors. \n As pharmaceutically active ingredients continue to become more ''potent'' the effective controlled delivery of doses have become intriguing. As a result, polymers now often constitute the major portion of many pharmaceutical dosage forms and as such can have profound impact on the reproducibility of drug release and overall performance of the dosage forms. The technical complexities associated with drug development have increased in controlled delivery due to challenges such as complex drug actives, and in cases of biotech products, stabilization of the active ingredient.

The participative service innovation behaviour (cleanliness) positively influences exploration intention(tourism) in this context. Furthermore, participative service innovation behaviour (in cleanliness) is found to mediate the relationship between its two driving factors, namely local community engagement and perceived trust in the service provider(tourism). The findings also provide various strategies tourism and hospitality firms and government tourism departments can use to prioritize factors and co-creating a replicable model of service innovation effectively using Mawlynnong example.", "authors": [{"name": "Neeraj  Sharma", "ids": ["2087071033"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Bijoylaxmi  Sarmah", "ids": ["35878474"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["c827c6657580bc1e00803301c4759a48037f2804", "ce655e66c6938bbe88603994eac23458815e691e", "4ed2089ebfee7f6122322ef8dcde6392c227ec0f", "c09c684d2cd8b7d1c9743defee5aa2b44737eaf2", "3a40c6b32c69f2c49a58a94b4318b69a9d652e24", "d4f66d960b695ec137dc11298bff4b0eff41776d", "92e9579c7a3b4cae6e3eaf5b5a6b1f9f7bb69489", "e6ccd701b2977d91336452676ce02c4c8b700105", "d3d02368229de86833057d4460f57ac6d52002b2", "45d1fb62469dd9a4b335195a304a3dac0e326905"], "outCitations": ["2c755e3525471d9af99cfe28ad1a8b4b6df480bf", "abef329b770b36685a80e7f3b95e283df47e04d3", "ee7ca49cc459dc14aec8a766af23711ad5b79f8b", "5ce55033ef29f67ba5a9bf746f96962364c33e4d", "0b506577aa1ab4ecf3b9c8047709043a0fcc76d0", "7b85f5e512c84c1bcbda06dcf27a7da223d2c9e2", "1d371785fbb37ea0ff83da40c7ac03fc68cbd257", "860493bf22470415bff44750cd27019e0fc0cc55", "b78500ee7a9f8d80ead95708e3a5d5fef31820d0", "dc653e4c535ae3fe433e0fcd107c7d3458a5715a", "fe9f84b8b9830a3d3042e876235e488f9aab661b", "9da453a214c31628c4953e5183185c3bb0189c7c", "1e29f1fdd8ff5e40272a939523d387b7c341f80b", "5439440425606a067df032c08d4c59cba02be752", "f18d6379d5b0201cf83c5171b0697b47bcaf8a3d", "e8e4e64c6205089c21f66658da6e9a28bf27f39c", "d8aa7a5194c4a9c02f863ce03f4324c17a6e5df1", "1e83fd391a3cd47035c9a839f15c01a72624de2b", "519a68d26a2078026c3fef78824fd9de5333db7e", "b07ec6925fb448457273d2a3f524136ee3fa092d", "e2f4f64a17a05379e45f713d10d7c546bda7734a", "7acb95d4d9311a53f0bd501e7e15fd60ca7d200d", "d8844492a30bc886f7f485636900ad19f97d818f", "2db59724056a3ed34cc61b4fe696258b1f718a6d", "c417bb2e5b9acd4b7f56201159db470541f34b73", "50326ffe576144d29060cfe2d6e06f285f87a727", "21779eccaedb76e80c6aa2715bef874056a28eb6", "91243a52d1ee664b22935a8c43491123719fb14f", "26df3ffff8f16ae25e42ebf09f3807e508c3ae14", "0bf42e648b3009bb39f670066f326853831bffb5", "67db05c44b425e982f745c80c2d6ad5626cd221d", "72063cfd91f213c84ed7b69942e7453e73794933", "b59a78ce605167cf7866c5cf7f1e4a42c089f353", "7a084e022c25c58cbaa74efc682bb4bb01114c1c", "3c7542a16f3435a094c486a490c79e0765138dbe", "4d549cd1c24ebb0ef9716d7531aa09277a189a36", "262f73b448f7707d28cc6878f857e2f2c73fa93f", "769d32122e316075dbe7202456d493fb2c65bedb", "95190ffbea587e21a63de1a2895d31fc6f09af9a", "fc5b0f7ecc2c1af72203f5ea669ca534c8f8e4a9", "07f09ee477fc72ce98a96955d174592974a4c4cd", "a66030f2714e76d9fcd6589dae435a395d597d34", "2045638fc7dfa13ae7fe0aeb73a98d42e1b8f169"], "year": 2019, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6161aa5c7ee6f921fea2065315552dbc384b8c95", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "Journal of Global Scholars of Marketing Science", "journalName": "Journal of Global Scholars of Marketing Science", "journalVolume": "29", "journalPages": "248 - 265", "doi": "10.1080/21639159.2019.1577692", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1080/21639159.2019.1577692", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business"], "magId": "2921057380", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Part I (AMAT, CY, LLTC and XLNX Case Studies)", "paperAbstract": "A previous study failed to identify economic benefits to explain the 2006-2007 popularity of accelerated stock repurchase programs (ASRs) funded through issuance of convertible debt. The case study of a $600 million transaction by Cypress Semiconductor did find cosmetic advantages in terms of earnings presentation (expenses largely bypass the income statement to go directly to the equity account instead). The deal was profitable for Cypress, but other structures offered superior risk/reward, the ASR component appeared easily $15 million overpriced, and reporting was problematic. The current study looks at ASRs of four companies. In addition to the Cypress ASR, those of Applied Materials, Linear Technology, and Xilinx are considered. Execution, reporting, and performance of all four ASRs are troublesome. The initial ASR commitments are at prices 5-15% higher than the companies' stock prices in the week prior to execution. Insofar as the initial stock delivery is followed by any subsequent deliveries, pricing on subsequent deliveries is subject to idiosyncratic reporting that tends to obscure (no price given) or substantially understate (price averaged over multiple reporting periods) the actual price paid on transactions in any given period. All surveyed companies fail to disclose the negotiated premium or discount versus VWAP (volume weighted average price) for their ASRs, the exact timeframe for calculation of VWAP, and VWAP specifications (such as exclusion of trades by the company, bankers and investors involved in the ASR and related transactions). Companies that execute ASRs ought to disclose VWAP benchmark terms, uniformly report monthly stock transactions that reflect the actual price paid (if any) for shares when delivered, and, if appropriate, ascribe a portion of the total ASR outlay to a fee. While ASRs enjoy no 10b-18 safe harbor against charges of manipulation, they carry the usual 10b-18/10b5-1 governance freight plus the added baggage of misleading disclosures and disturbing, pre-deal, pricing patterns. Whether ASRs facilitate efficient execution of large buybacks with superior governance may be an open question, but the need for better disclosure seems reasonably conclusive.", "authors": [{"name": "M.
