The implementation of this curriculum brings some impacts to teaching, English as the example. Its implementation challenges the teachers to teach many English basic competences with only limited face-to-face time, 2 periods or once in a week. This circumstance challenges English teachers to find an effective way to teach their students so that they can accomplish all basic competences with only limited time. One of the methods used is learning autonomy. This study focuses on Vocational High School English teachers' roles in empowering students' learning autonomy towards the implementation of the 2013 curriculum.

The researcher first conducted quantitative research, analyzed the results and then built on the results to explain them in more detail with qualitative research The result of this research showed that the subjects face a new challenge towards the implementation of the 2013 Curriculum in their English teaching. The subjects were found apply learning autonomy method as a way to achieve the goal of the 2013 Curriculum. This method is applied because the subjects believe that learning autonomy is providing language learners with the ability to be more responsible to their own learning.
