In the present study, we used pneumatic linear drives to develop a linearly actuated parallel mechanism, in which the actuators fixed on a base enable high degrees of freedom of motion of an endeffector. Using pneumatic linear drives in the realization of such a parallel mechanism leads to lightweight, compact, and low-cost construction. For the parallel mechanism prototype, we construct a control system based on our previously proposed networked Just-In-Time (JIT) control strategy, which is based on client-server architecture. In this system, the parallel mechanism is connected to a client computer, and a server computer has a database that stores the control data for all the pneumatic actuators to drive the parallel mechanism. The client online accesses the database, receives data from the server, and feeds control commands to the pneumatic actuators. Experiments were performed to investigate the performance of the developed parallel mechanism system.", "authors": [{"name": "Takahiro  Kosaki", "ids": ["2584447"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Manabu  Sano", "ids": ["50680023"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["7130c984a3478128367f4e57e9dafc2727028bee", "a3d449b0ac8109e392a160c73322616c5cfb8c90", "c624f160aecca9b64ab24113edcb30c71f9c2906", "6e19365636fceeaaf201b84f75e0f44af79dd053", "1db7d66e37e03390c76ff293ef588f4646571ec0", "6435c06ffc323ec20147891eb9979ab3f92839f8"], "outCitations": ["419b4105f78d201b664704bc3940cee706958ec2", "e3bf37570a7091ccbcd5f79c21bdb3c6ba21a7c5", "01a8cfffdd7f4e17d1be08f6c6259cfbbae661f4", "42872415b5d0f3a0894c1f4ebdc5a165604a6228", "7ac4059b5f314c177458c01ceab9f09f04fb322a", "979072e88257b9cc618bc07320beedf2f27dcdb2", "6b5736335320763f0612669e27e2560689097e30", "924a31dd657ee48e6e68e4f1aca37353f7929951", "e56556478a7b309b1233b1109d5c22087a6f4c1c", "d8da75d066a31c27a96bf80301f5217c3371c933", "84e2ad9dc9962dd999472ccb8c884f5620bdf27c", "1acbdbbd938ccb17413657016c67eb51dd6c2d13", "822c94be466a1b317c64c8eb3b209894dfa422f4", "9a783505cc243ac0321730770c5400cfcf47f856"], "year": 2014, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4577f5afb43b5852e7ff2fcc8b6e96e0753c9655", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "2", "journalPages": "19-25", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2346791912", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

Following our participation in the 2 AIAA CFD High Lift Prediction Workshop (HiLiftPW-2), the EUROLIFT DLR-F11 multi-element wing geometry is considered in this work, as it is representative of a wide-body commercial aircraft that features a continuous full span slat and flap in landing setting. The complexity and size of this geometric model present serious challenges for meshing and high-fidelity modeling of these systems. Moreover, full scale DES simulations of such geometries require very fine mesh resolution in key locations of the computational domain (e.g. boundary layers, wake of the flap, tips, etc) and massively parallel resources to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in a timely manner. To achieve these fine resolutions in an efficient manner, an adaptive approach is highly desirable. In this paper, the computational approach used for these DES simulations is a mature finite-element flow solver (PHASTA) employed with anisotropic adaptive meshing and partitioning procedures. The Reynolds number is set to Re = 1.35M and an angle of attack of 7 is considered. The initial mesh design for a 7 angle of attack with DES is discussed, along with the associated adapted mesh. Preliminary results are also provided to identify what is resolved on the initial and adapted meshes and what, in future work, will be required to bring further agreement with the experiments. RANS simulations on the same meshes are also discussed since they serve as an initial condition for the DES.", "authors": [{"name": "Michel  Rasquin", "ids": ["2582996"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Kedar C.

Since the virtual and actual control parts of the dynamics of each follower agent are power functions containing positive odd rational numbers, the method of adding a power integrator is used to overcome the controller design difficulties caused by the power functions. With the aid of a finite-time performance function (FTPF) and neural networks (NNs), a distributed adaptive finite-time consensus tracking controller with prescribed tracking performance is properly designed by the backstepping process. It is shown that the proposed control strategy can guarantee that the consensus tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood around zero at any settling time, while all signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally practical finite-time stable (SGPF-stable). Finally, a simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "authors": [{"name": "Jiehan  Liu", "ids": ["51434890"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Chaoli  Wang", "ids": ["152745080"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Xuan  Cai", "ids": ["2145065229"], "structuredName": null}], "inCitations": ["9e81cac4872ea95a4f8ba73fc3da05ff757572f9", "534ae4550cc0929f3360dbe6f1c18a6cac557c69", "413e8338446e9fb47fee55f89f21f40de3658fc7"], "outCitations": ["7d4856bb59fd3cc7777c1ef255521acc7b8046bf", "8f65fb9456b08e06c451bde0a1717db06a9e26cc", "f5d3a3bd6c3296ce3756f94c6bcd3d129e37b214", "0994611c00aba3cca1514ac3acd4c0745ba03c4a", "f85bf834c4e28940fadef96edffae6399f7262f5", "f334af9d9d18e002d6b9076a8c1b0b1208d8f894", "0f610e1932acef18a5dc7beb1a1bcce3ec23fbfb", "e6ce7d52abc9ee487bafdad80765a32bb6d9308f", "dc513e4fe39dcb9aaf180021684ba142b0175273", "21d5534779e8054ee8ae6636cf655a237462061f", "fdf9f991a2f6c437c630a7b15328fa86776ac693", "2abf7dd7acebc5a1327339510e4225c421ccec3c", "284947414d3a03ee109278ccb4089b44298f01f2", "6d0ac83195cf7159cf75817534c047f9ce66d47d", "851a6d952ff4869189a44b42a6cb27d071789ce5", "c2ff5dad8b2e3e927023141f74bbbd4b8f21baaa", "fde0e3ed9f30e7bf11e03b0ae4ebfcfb57013398", "760199125357f1e0c4739d8bfe76ac8c0950848d", "ee0db22a39d309330afdf03bd6b8e5426a1f1504", "bfff1ad9169af447970b365c903180c0985b91e7", "26e9cb962d98a9710ca5229522cf3d1dd1e9a2c4", "f35ec1a529cb32578144827c9654aa513fdb7def", "3679953e1f2209ab728b626420999811b2f7bfcf", "012ce40225de8512e85e8679fd508bfb880128fd", "349d21aaabb5c40ed553a7e1ead1bae89a701550", "e951f3a69245e408f8d6df66c2fc9c338ee50c1f", "bdfb478ee6e730390f242fcccb7028b12f686f6a", "24efa3a790dfb0711c54443bcfd639c4e1a7ad10", "a906bf3332af1a34d75df176760ab5097d68046d", "9dd2b1b7c8a7daef174bf17a3bc08c5b7bd23b18", "acc3b5a96b9594e4b3493da901130db6f3974a38", "bcb3e7d7847de63b078f7a861b9f2ee124131f85", "2f199a1896f88639d28d57c3e3ea492dec3bdb11", "6152969bd1d2851a87c04e7c9699d0dc0ab7203b", "faafa94e971a5ad84a75ba77ea68975b5efeb537", "2928d412fc4736a29194e5432f59744dced7a469", "68ec8a1e9aea1916e2280489729bab74d5bf6631", "16265249ccc4e29d9d9aef7c6a08b75f0a943d1f", "1ba585c374ba84cb7a6ca53d36a7641627d9397b", "1752e77f9b678ac425c6ecd5b85ded1673aad624", "114ea788fc999d15c5e47d224be19a13c131d4b4", "f00c0506cead2c1cbec8de2cf200976cfeb17b2a", "a1d35faa62e505cb5aa973c9d80d54c4b841139f", "a581cc896fca46e1da74bcacf66d3853b0b18da4", "3270033e68266db39889d0e3d7b56115aa2132dc", "177e5f093fbd8a5a3f1be914f170ba6b12353064", "829f983ae68011a504d9cd6699d8faccf12ce53a"], "year": 2021, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bfbe65e7aea0740358843414a828a8aaf7e55b09", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2020.08.051"], "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journalName": "Neurocomputing", "journalVolume": "419", "journalPages": "157-167", "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2020.08.051", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2020.08.051", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "3083236950", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": []}

At Berkeley, we have introduced a new course that introduces signals and systems to EECS majors. A major objective of the course is to introduce applications early, well before the students have built up enough theory to fully analyze the applications. This helps to motivate the students to learn the theory. Indeed, a major theme of this course is the connection between a mathematical (declarative) and a computational (imperative) view of systems. In particular, we avoid using software as merely a more convenient way to do calculations that could otherwise be done by hand. Instead, we emphasize the use of software to perform operations that could not possibly be done by hand, operations on real signals such as sounds and images.

{"id": "7a304933631fcf70a2a244e53bfaf118f705defe", "title": "A mechanistic model of energy consumption in milling", "paperAbstract": "In this paper, a novel mechanistic model is proposed and validated for the consumption of energy in milling processes. The milling machine is considered as a thermodynamic system. Mechanisms of the significant energy conversion processes within the system are used to construct an explicit expression for the power consumption of the machine as a function of the cutting parameters. This model has been validated experimentally and is shown to be significantly more accurate than popular existing models. A simplified form of the model is also proposed that provides a balance between complexity and accuracy. The novelty of the model is that it maps the flow of energy within a machine tool, based solely on the active mechanisms of energy conversion. As a result, only limited assumptions are made in the model, resulting in an error of less than one per cent, verified by experiments. This accurate model can be used to substantially reduce energy consumption in milling processes at machine and factory levels leading to massive cost savings and reduction of environmental impact of numerous industries. The generality of the modelling method makes it applicable to other types of machine tools with minimal adjustments.", "authors": [{"name": "Reza Imani Asrai", "ids": ["96246408"], "structuredName": null}, {"name": "Stephen T.
